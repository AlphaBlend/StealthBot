 [12:10:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> yay ;p\
 [12:11:02 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> groups?
 [12:11:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [12:12:15 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> whats the groups array store
 [12:12:31 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> does "bob" have to be a group
 [12:12:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> you should name it .GroupMembers() or something
 [12:13:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Obviously, Groups() stores the name of the groups the the user is a member of.
 [12:13:33 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> oh, but they can be in only one group =/
 [12:13:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Technically, support exists for multiple groupings.
 [12:14:18 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> hwo would i go about putting someone in two groups then?
 [12:14:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Use a comma in --groups.
 [12:14:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> or --group, rather.
 [12:14:55 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ... would that cause any errors with the db manager?
 [12:15:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [12:15:34 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i mean a tree layout can't show two nodes of the same person, that would cause more problems like synchronization
 [12:15:44 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, currently, you can not accurately view users with multiple groupings.

 [03:17:22 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth>  [05:19:46 PM] <Hero.A> Eric, Add the command

 [03:17:49 PM] <PhiX> and while you're at it, add a cremove command o.o
 [03:17:54 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth>  [05:19:46 PM] <Hero.A> Eric, Add the command
 [03:17:56 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth>  [05:19:54 PM] <Hero.A> !setbnlsserver <server>
 [03:17:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> cremove?
 [03:17:58 PM] -- mr.bean(roc)@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [03:18:05 PM] <PhiX> remove from clan
 [03:18:16 PM] <PhiX> since we have a demote and promote
 [03:18:17 PM] <PhiX> why not cremove
 [03:18:25 PM] <PhiX> remove is already taken
 [03:18:38 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Because remove can be used to kill clans?
 [03:19:00 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you can have less than three members in your clan and it will still exist
 [03:19:02 PM] <PhiX> it's as harmful as promote/demote
 [03:19:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Security isn't a huge concern since none of these commands will be added with access in commands.xml.
 [03:19:30 PM] <PhiX> but will you add it?
 [03:19:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> possible.
 [03:19:48 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth>  [05:19:46 PM] <Hero.A> Eric, Add the command
 [03:19:50 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth>  [05:19:54 PM] <Hero.A> !setbnlsserver <server>
 [03:19:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> possible.

 [03:20:49 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> PhiX dont count
 [03:20:51 PM] <PhiX> I'LL MAKE A NEW ONE
 [03:20:54 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Lets remake it!
 [03:20:55 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> WOOT

 [04:04:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> can you demote hakr?
 [04:04:56 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ban evasion bans people if they were banned before, and you rejoined

 [04:12:58 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> or to keep banned people out?

 [04:13:18 PM] <PhiX> obviously

 [04:13:30 PM] <PhiX> but
 [04:13:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why would Stealth have added two commands to do the same thing?  Silly, Jack.
 [04:13:35 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea, so why'd you do !lm to find out... its obvious
 [04:13:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ban evasion how it is, is better.
 [04:13:42 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> silly jack, bots are for battle.net
 [04:13:43 PM] <PhiX> letting ban evasion do the job is funnier
 [04:13:48 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> 'ers
 [04:13:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but if i kept my banlist, that'd be better.
 [04:13:49 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> *
 [04:13:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> stealth did add two commands to do the same

 [04:14:05 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth>  /? rejoin
 [04:14:06 PM] <PhiX> I obviously found out by using the command, ribose
 [04:14:08 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> doesnt resign give them ops
 [04:14:12 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> like
 [04:14:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Those are two different commands, Ribose.
 [04:14:15 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> if i do -resign
 [04:14:17 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> the bot ops me
 [04:14:18 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> instead
 [04:14:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They're differences are subtle, but different.
 [04:14:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> connection and eric type /? rejoin
 [04:14:27 PM] <PhiX> where is the difference?
 [04:14:43 PM] <PhiX> rejoin and resign are aliases for battle.net
 [04:14:47 PM] <Alendar> T___T

 [04:15:01 PM] <Alendar> Still, not answer.
 [04:15:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The /resign command is a Battle.net command, whereas the rejoin command is an internal command.

 [04:15:18 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> eric.
 [04:15:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> they do the same thing though.
 [04:15:22 PM] <Alendar>     Friend WithEvents tpcIRC As System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
 [04:15:30 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> do you think you could have the bot say the full name when it jumps to a song
 [04:15:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ./rejoin and /resign may work the same on Battle.net, but StealthBot's "rejoin" command is functionally distinct.
 [04:15:46 PM] <PhiX> that's annoying
 [04:15:53 PM] <PhiX> don't call it rejoin then
 [04:15:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Moreover, with the new flagging system, each will carry with it it's own, again, subtle difference.
 [04:16:08 PM] <PhiX> when I use the rejoin command, I assume the bnet one is being used
 [04:16:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if i dont have access to use .rejoin, i could use .resign
 [04:16:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net's rejoin command only works when you're an op.
 [04:16:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's abusing the bot by using something i shouldnt have access to
 [04:16:43 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> resign is not rejoin
 [04:16:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> resign only works when you're an op.
 [04:17:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ....
 [04:17:11 PM] <Alendar is currently: Good Current Project: Unknown My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [04:17:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can still abuse bots that are ops.

 [04:19:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> change what?
 [04:19:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you're the dev.
 [04:19:11 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Your friend Bot-Vector has exited Battle.net.
 [04:19:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> commands.xml.
 [04:19:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> gogogogo.
 [04:19:20 PM] <PhiX> remove commands.xml
 [04:19:22 PM] <PhiX> problem solved
 [04:19:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> lol
 [04:19:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol.
 [04:19:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not everyone is going to change the commands.xml to remove this problem
 [04:19:39 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Your friend Bot-Vector has entered Battle.net.
 [04:19:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> just like the math commands, not everyone knows about it
 [04:19:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That would lock down the bot to the degree to which Jack would be satisfied.
 [04:19:51 PM] <PhiX> make it require the same access by default
 [04:19:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and once people start finding out about resign, they'll start abusing it
 [04:20:09 PM] <PhiX> there weren't 2 different commands in 2.6R3, were there?
 [04:20:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The ranking system is stupid... plain and simple.
 [04:20:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It opens the door to a whole host of vulnerabilities.
 [04:20:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The flagging system compensates for that.
 [04:20:41 PM] <PhiX> I'm giving you hits, idiat
 [04:20:50 PM] The "rejoin" command will make the bot rejoin the current channel, and requires either 80 access or flag 'J'. [Syntax: <trigger>rejoin ] [more]

 [05:28:02 PM] <Tech-Vector@Azeroth> Invalid server as a second argument. Use a real battle.net server (uswest/useast, etc.) or realm.
 [05:28:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> hm
 [05:28:10 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hi Eric.
 [05:28:10 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> anyone know what the bottleneck is for the time it takes sb to connect?
 [05:28:25 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Whatever latency it has to the battle.net server.

 [05:28:55 PM] <AdBot-MAGE@Azeroth> it didn't activate.
 [05:29:15 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, how come you are slow to type?
 [05:29:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [05:29:25 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh
 [05:29:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What bottleneck?
 [05:29:34 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> And the bypass is still possible via scripting in DR2
 [05:29:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm aware.  It's fixed correctly in dev 3.
 [05:29:55 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> k
 [05:30:02 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> We'll see about that :)
 [05:30:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> What exactly did you fix?
 [05:30:29 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> the connecting part of the time, i was curious what takes the most time in that
 [05:30:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> oh.
 [05:30:48 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh.
 [05:31:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> CheckRevision() is the most lengthy procedure.
 [05:31:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Probably after it disconnects from the BNLS, that it uses BNCSutil
 [05:31:17 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I would have figured.
 [05:31:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The older versions take ~15ms.
 [05:31:55 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Will the STarcraft Demo ever get to the A6 VerByte?
 [05:31:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> BNLS, of course, is a bottleneck as well.
 [05:32:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No, Vector.
 [05:32:16 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> there are times where it says "Connecting" for at least 3 to 5 seconds
 [05:32:17 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> not everytime
 [05:32:29 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> is that BNLS?
 [05:32:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> [BNLS] or [BNET], which is it?
 [05:32:48 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> :)
 [05:32:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'd be more apt to blaim dns resolution difficulties.
 [05:33:01 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [05:33:14 PM] <Funnel91111@Azeroth> ERICZ!
 [05:33:15 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Well, yeah.
 [05:33:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (if you're using an fqdn istead of an ip address, that is)
 [05:33:27 PM] <Funnel91111@Azeroth> arn't ypu supposed to be banned?
 [05:33:29 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Are you saying resolving <realm>.battle.net?
 [05:33:29 PM] <Funnel91111@Azeroth> :P
 [05:33:37 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> lmao
 [05:33:45 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He's shitlisted on Mage_'s bot.
 [05:33:51 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Lol
 [05:34:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't know, Funnel.  That seems like a silly question to ask someone, really.
 [05:34:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth>  lmao
 [05:34:25 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Funnel aren't you supposed to be banned?
 [05:34:28 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, you know why Scott hates you?
 [05:34:30 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> When did you get unbanned?
 [05:34:36 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Scott = DarkMage
 [05:35:04 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It's because that issue regarding me giving tech support on his account should have been rsolved.
 [05:35:27 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> I'm reading The Singularity is Near Eric, pretty good book so far
 [05:35:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, how far are you in?
 [05:35:40 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [05:35:47 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> a third maybe
 [05:35:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ah.  It gets better as you get further in.
 [05:36:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The first sections is extremely technical.
 [05:36:27 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> yeah, there were like 12 pages of graphs in a row lol
 [05:36:37 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> after 3 i was like, yeah i get the trend
 [05:36:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [05:38:39 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> mm
 [05:38:50 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I think this "vouch", "dota", and baal plugin thing is stupid.
 [05:38:58 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Indeed.
 [05:39:04 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Especially the banlist. Isn't Warcraft supposed to be fun?
 [05:39:18 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> baal is diable isn't it
 [05:39:24 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> diablo*
 [05:40:13 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> It's all stupid.
 [05:40:38 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> throw trivia in that list
 [05:40:55 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> What is wrong with trivia?
 [05:41:11 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Gives people something to do when there just chatting or searching for a game.
 [05:41:22 PM] <Tech-Vector@Azeroth [7:23:40 PM] <ClanGnome> Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son .: StealthBot v2.6 Revision 3>
 [05:41:37 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> yeah if its a trivia designated channel where ppl go for that
 [05:41:44 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> but throw it in someone's clan channel
 [05:41:47 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> and its just annoying
 [05:41:56 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [05:41:58 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> u can squelch it, but you still have to watch everyone answer lol
 [05:42:01 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hey...
 [05:42:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I have trivia every once in awhile
 [05:42:08 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Then go to a different channel?

 [07:07:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth : What was going through the minds of all of Chuck Norris' victims before they died? His shoe.>
 [07:08:13 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> You should allow ID or Name
 [07:08:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> impossible until i start making my database
 [07:08:44 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> really?
 [07:08:49 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yes
 [07:09:07 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> there is not devine sql data base of Username, MEMID?

 [07:09:16 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but i cant access it
 [07:09:19 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> =[
 [07:09:58 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> because it has personal info?
 [07:10:10 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> no, because i dont have access to it..
 [07:10:17 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> ask someone!
 [07:10:18 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> =o
 [07:10:20 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> there is no real reason for me to..
 [07:10:29 PM] <Alendar> Hmm.
 [07:10:36 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> well it would be awesome for this script -.-
 [07:10:40 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth :: [23:40:33] <Ersan> Your Mom is like a struct. She's got no class! :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 :.>
 [07:10:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> im going to make my own database
 [07:10:50 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so eventually, it will work
 [07:10:57 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> waste of time
 [07:11:00 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> =O
 [07:11:06 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> bored.
 [07:11:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> making the script wont take that long
 [07:11:14 PM] <Alendar> Like always/
 [07:11:36 PM] <Alendar> My us a plugin to do our homework.
 [07:11:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> scinetting a page for every single number 1 to 19,335 is the part that will tkae a while
 [07:11:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> oo
 [07:12:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i see
 [07:12:06 PM] <Alendar> Make*
 [07:12:33 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> 1000 scinets only takes a few minutes
 [07:12:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so like a few hours
 [07:12:59 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> hmm
 [07:13:02 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> im confused
 [07:13:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> it has to get a shitload of info from them at the same time
 [07:13:03 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [07:13:10 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> 1-19335?
 [07:13:21 PM] <Alendar> "We have 19,335 registered members"
 [07:13:30 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> if you goto 19,335 you get myndfyer
 [07:13:32 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> but
 [07:13:37 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> if you goto 19335
 [07:13:50 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> it goes says nothing exists there
 [07:13:53 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> because going to 19,335 is going to 19
 [07:13:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> oh my bad
 [07:13:57 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> and i went to the last person registered
 [07:13:58 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> and it was
 [07:14:00 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> 34316
 [07:14:01 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> the newest member is number 34316
 [07:14:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> k 1 to 34316
 [07:14:13 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> yea
 [07:14:24 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> 19335 is the registered users, not the highest ID
 [07:14:29 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> that doesn't account for deleted accounts
 [07:14:36 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i still wish i could see all of the info that i can see from my account
 [07:14:36 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> so
 [07:14:40 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [07:14:44 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then i oculd get ip addresses

 [07:15:28 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> 19335 is the amount of people that are actually signed up - the people who signed up and never did anything?

 [07:17:24 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> A more efficient way, Pyro, would be to crawl the member list and extract URLs of current accounts, instead of guess-and-checking every ID

 [07:27:57 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> i just thought of something
 [07:28:15 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> cam!
 [07:28:20 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> IPB doesn't allow you to post javascript, but if you post the javascript in an iframe won't that work?
 [07:28:27 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> I dont know
 [07:28:29 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> maybe
 [07:28:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> maybe ;o
 [07:28:53 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> Actually
 [07:28:56 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Of course it will
 [07:28:58 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> yea
 [07:29:01 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> it should
 [07:29:04 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> excellent
 [07:29:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what javascript are you going to post?
 [07:29:10 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> HTML is done straight up, SMF doesn't do anything
 [07:29:20 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> dunno
 [07:29:20 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> it
 [07:29:28 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> it's nice to know that that's an option though
 [07:29:30 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> And by the way, smart people use NoScript
 [07:29:41 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> i use noscript, but i allow javascript on sb.net!
 [07:29:52 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> ah, well
 [07:29:54 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> iframe wont' be on sb.net
 [07:29:55 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> duh
 [07:29:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=31418
 [07:30:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> noscript is controlling
 [07:30:17 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> but probably most people have javascript enabled for idiat.com?
 [07:30:19 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Too bad NoScript doesn't allow cross-site code execution.
 [07:30:20 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> :P
 [07:30:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if you turn it off it tells you like 6 different times "you may be in great danger"
 [07:30:31 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I actually have idiat.com on my deny list.
