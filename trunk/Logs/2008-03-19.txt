 [02:48:21 PM] <PhiX> if the other ops delete the banned users from their list when the ops who banned them leaves the channel, ban evasion would have no purpose anymore
 [02:48:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If several ops ban the same user, I'm going to record that information and not remove the user from the ban list.
 [02:49:18 PM] <PhiX> that's the same issue though
 [02:49:29 PM] <PhiX> ban evasion should keep banned users outside, like when my bot drops
 [02:49:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Ban evasions purpose is to prevent users from coming back with a different key.
 [02:49:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The shitlists purpose is to maintain bans across drops.
 [02:50:13 PM] <PhiX> but when my bot is offline ... the shitlist can't take affect
 [02:50:34 PM] <PhiX> and if I don't have access to other ops bots, the user would be still banned due to ban evasion

 [05:46:31 PM] <Chris.W> The /mp3 command with iTunes isn't working as intended..
 [05:46:43 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its because itunes sucks
 [05:46:53 PM] <Chris.W> True
 [05:47:01 PM] <Chris.W> But winamp doesn't work with my iPod.

 [05:48:34 PM] <Chris.W> the track numbers don't match up

 [05:50:02 PM] <Chris.W> ALTHOUGH
 [05:50:25 PM] <Chris.W> the /next command is playing songs that aren't checked
 [05:51:21 PM] <Eric[nK]> The iTunes class in StealthBot is more or less just a front-end for the iTunes ActiveX object.
 [05:51:32 PM] <Eric[nK]> It would be pretty difficult to create such errors.
 [05:51:45 PM] <Chris.W> I dunno then
 [05:51:54 PM] <Chris.W> I have the Harry Potter books loaded in itunes
 [05:51:55 PM] <Eric[nK]> SB's iTunes Next function, simply calls iTunesObj.Next().
 [05:51:57 PM] <Eric[nK]> lol
 [05:52:00 PM] <Chris.W> but I don't have them checked, so they shouldn't play
 [05:52:03 PM] <Chris.W> but

 [06:50:15 PM] <Chris.W> Hi
 [06:50:25 PM] <Chris.W>  //who clan snap
 [06:50:26 PM] <Ribose-5> wc3 has marines
 [06:50:34 PM] <Chris.W> Not the kind with rifles.
 [06:50:40 PM] <Chris.W> Automatic rifles*
 [06:50:45 PM] <Ribose-5> someone made a custom game with the marine model
 [06:50:49 PM] <HaKr[bot]@Azeroth> Darkmage is so pro
 [06:50:53 PM] <Chris.W> Thats custom though.
 [06:51:01 PM] <Ribose-5> and it was pretty awsome, it was a 3D marine!
 [06:51:04 PM] <Ribose-5> gg

 [06:51:05 PM] <Chris.W> Lol.

 [06:51:18 PM] <Ribose-5> there were hydras and lings and ghosts i think
 [06:51:28 PM] <Ribose-5> no kidding, but thats not out yet is it?
 [06:51:31 PM] <Chris.W> No.
 [06:51:35 PM] <Chris.W> Unfortunately.
 [06:51:36 PM] <Chris.W> >_<
 [06:51:41 PM] <Ribose-5> yea
 [06:51:47 PM] <Chris.W> It looks so awesome though...
 [06:51:49 PM] <Ribose-5> i wanna play sc2 so bad
 [06:51:59 PM] <Chris.W> Have you seen the blizz video where the lings spell GG at the end?
 [06:52:02 PM] <Ribose-5> im a sc fan
 [06:52:07 PM] <Ribose-5> yea
 [06:52:09 PM] <Chris.W> Lol.
 [06:52:13 PM] <Chris.W> Simply amazing.

 [06:52:35 PM] <Chris.W> brb, taking a leak
 [06:52:36 PM] <Ribose-5> ever try to get close to 400 lings and then attack someone?
 [06:52:39 PM] <Ribose-5> like in bgh
 [06:52:43 PM] <Ribose-5> its hilarious
 [06:52:49 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> "that was gg to the lingmax"
 [06:52:50 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> ...
 [06:53:18 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> can you still stack hydras?
 [06:53:21 PM] <Ribose-5> shush my stupid jokes can be stupider
 [06:53:26 PM] <Ribose-5> doubtful
 [06:53:37 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i always loved stacking a shit load
 [06:53:38 PM] <Ribose-5> oh
 [06:53:42 PM] <Ribose-5> buried?
 [06:53:48 PM] <Ribose-5> yea probably
 [06:53:58 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> no.. not burying them

 [06:54:13 PM] <Chris.W> Nacl
 [06:54:18 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Stack them, where you can place.. say, 200 in the same spot (above ground)
 [06:54:22 PM] <Chris.W> back*
 [06:54:28 PM] <Chris.W> They disabled that
 [06:54:30 PM] <Chris.W> in the last patch
 [06:54:31 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> and own the enemy
 [06:54:33 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> ...
 [06:54:34 PM] <Chris.W> IIRC
 [06:54:34 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> gay
 [06:54:46 PM] <Ribose-5> they probably have a better algorithm to get the lings to where they can stand unlike in crappy sc1 where any stacked units take hours to get where they can stand =[
 [06:54:58 PM] <Ribose-5> not lings, units*
 [06:55:14 PM] <Ribose-5> because similarly you can make all the units float =/
 [06:55:20 PM] <Chris.W> From being unburrowed?
 [06:55:25 PM] <Chris.W> Oh
 [06:55:28 PM] <Chris.W> IIRC they disabled that too
 [06:55:33 PM] <Chris.W> the whole floating thing
 [06:55:36 PM] <Ribose-5> or from being "stacked" at mining
 [06:55:41 PM] <Chris.W> I used to use it to scout the map
 [06:55:52 PM] <Chris.W> That makes mining so much easier though
 [06:56:02 PM] <Ribose-5> no they can't float off ridges, its just that they take forever to get over each other
 [06:56:07 PM] <Chris.W> When the minerals aren't stacked, the units won't stack to mine them
 [06:56:31 PM] <Ribose-5> i doubt you can stack anything in a 3d environment
 [06:56:35 PM] <Ribose-5> if they made it right
 [06:56:39 PM] <Chris.W> Would be nifty to try
 [06:56:50 PM] <Chris.W> I just had a thought
 [06:57:03 PM] <Chris.W> Halflife 2, and a few other games have the Havok generator
 [06:57:10 PM] <Chris.W> for a realistic environment
 [06:57:15 PM] <Alendar> Current MP3 [30/75]: P.O.D. - Boom (01:52/03:06)
 [06:57:16 PM] <Chris.W> Do you think they have anything like that?
 [06:57:21 PM] <Chris.W> Current MP3 [13/1858]: La Isla Bonita (03:00/03:35)
 [06:57:25 PM] <Ribose-5> i donno
 [06:57:28 PM] <Chris.W> Mine doesn't list the artist...
 [06:57:35 PM] <Chris.W> It's Alizee though
 [06:57:36 PM] <Ribose-5> but did you see how they had the falling dead barracks
 [06:57:39 PM] <Alendar> iTunes?
 [06:57:40 PM] <Ribose-5> and bc
 [06:57:40 PM] <Chris.W> She's gorgeous.
 [06:57:47 PM] <Ribose-5> that rolled downt he ramp
 [06:57:48 PM] <Chris.W> I didn't see the barracks
 [06:57:58 PM] <Chris.W> I use iTunes, Alendar.
 [06:58:03 PM] <Alendar> That's why.
 [06:58:05 PM] <Chris.W> ?
 [06:58:06 PM] <Ribose-5> maybe it was jsut a bc, i watched it like 2 months ago
 [06:58:12 PM] <Alendar> iTunes is teh suckage.
 [06:58:16 PM] <Ribose-5> but yea, things roll down, full down
 [06:58:24 PM] <Alendar> Right Ribose?
 [06:58:25 PM] <Chris.W> iTunes supports iPods.
 [06:58:30 PM] <Ribose-5> instead of air units jsut going poof
 [06:58:30 PM] <Alendar> So does Winamp.
 [06:58:34 PM] <Chris.W> Nate, try and find that video if you can
 [06:58:43 PM] <Chris.W> Winamp doesn't add songs to my ipod
 [06:58:47 PM] <Ribose-5> which
 [06:58:49 PM] <Alendar> Fail.
 [06:58:57 PM] <Chris.W> Nor does winamp have such an extreme sorting method
 [06:59:08 PM] <Alendar> Pftt.
 [06:59:17 PM] <Alendar> Who needs extreme sorting.
 [06:59:22 PM] <Ribose-5> i dont think there was one with the barracks, i just can't remember what that falling thing they showed in that demo was
 [06:59:37 PM] <Alendar> HOLY CRAP :: http://www.simplehelp.net/images/winamp/winamp07b.jpg
 [06:59:37 PM] <Chris.W> Song name - Time - Artist - Track # - Disk # - Album - Year - Rating
 [06:59:42 PM] <Ribose-5> it was red in color ;o
