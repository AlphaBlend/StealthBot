 [02:58:59 PM] <Alendar>  [5:54:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> why it take so long to update channel lsit -- How long did it take?
 [02:59:06 PM] <Alendar> 3 seconds?
 [02:59:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> BotVars.Realm became BotVars.Gateway.
 [02:59:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Realm is easily confused with D2 realm.

 [03:06:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The data was originally sent using a user-defined type.
 [03:06:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then I realized I couldn't pass scripts udts.

 [03:07:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I didn't both providing backwards-compatibility due to the few number of users actually using the function and the ease of changing scripts.

 [03:07:24 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> mmk

 [03:26:06 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> A SCRIPTING ERROR WITH RIBOS'S PLUGIN GAVE ME AN IP BAN, KINDA
 [03:26:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> *RIBOSE'S
 [03:26:17 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> can you make it so hdx's rtbs start have scroll bars lkike the one on sb?
 [03:26:24 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i know
 [03:26:32 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i'm making all the changes due to the new beta
 [03:26:38 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and finishing the script
 [03:26:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Script errors should never cause ip bans.
 [03:26:55 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea that doesn't happen
 [03:27:04 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> well
 [03:27:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'd imagine it was ipban -> script error
 [03:27:16 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> odd coincidence
 [03:27:22 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth>  [18:28:19.427] <Ribose> can you make it so hdx's rtbs start have scroll bars lkike the one on sb?
 [03:27:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and the ip ban didnt even disconnect ALL my bots. only 2 or 3
 [03:27:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can't enable scroll bars during run-time?
 [03:27:51 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> no i ca't
 [03:28:10 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> just like you cant change window style during runtime
 [03:28:23 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> need separate createable windwos
 [03:28:38 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> although that would triplify the size of stealthbot :P
 [03:29:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Vertical scroll bars should now work correctly.
 [03:29:28 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> if only we were using .net, where objects can be made on windows dynamically
 [03:29:34 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ...
 [03:29:39 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> xD
 [03:29:48 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> stop talking about .net
 [03:29:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You should have mentioned it sooner, Ribose.
 [03:30:00 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> your only going to make the release of 2.7 be prolonged further
 [03:30:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [03:30:05 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i did
 [03:30:10 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> lol
 [03:30:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm seriously considering a C# or VB .NET 2.8.
 [03:30:27 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> not like it maters any more
 [03:30:33 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> c#
 [03:30:42 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> first convert it to vb.net
 [03:30:47 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> with the converter
 [03:30:55 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> then once all the bugs are out
 [03:30:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The converter will break in so many ways.
 [03:30:58 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that converter has NEVER worked for me
 [03:31:00 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [03:31:04 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> you can swifly move it to c#
 [03:31:22 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and .net languages are interchangeable almost
 [03:31:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> C# would allow for much more complex functionality.
 [03:31:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> With a complete redesign, profiling would become a viable option.

 [03:31:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The GUIs are also a lot cleaner.
 [03:32:03 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea, stealth comes back after a year
 [03:32:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> integrated XML support.
 [03:32:09 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> after he runs out of wow money
 [03:32:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Unicode/UTF-8 support.
 [03:32:19 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and we've remade the bot from the bottom up
 [03:32:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so its barely recognizable
 [03:32:51 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> :P
 [03:33:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i wouldnt like the bot as much if it went to c#, unless the scripting system stayed vb... if thats even possible lol
 [03:33:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it prolly is
 [03:33:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> if you call loadlibrary msscript.ocx
