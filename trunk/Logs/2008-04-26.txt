 [10:55:09 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> yea
 [10:55:15 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What I used to do is monitor how many joins occurred in the last ~30 seconds, and if it was above 10 or so, ban everyone that just joined and keep banning until the queue is empty.
 [10:55:23 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i do that

 [10:57:09 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ;o
 [10:57:59 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> And?
 [10:58:09 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Does it work?
 [10:58:25 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> it filters better than when its at 500
 [10:58:38 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, of course.
 [10:59:02 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The goal, however, isn't to filter all spam.  The goal is simply to protect your bot from crashing during an extremely fast flood.

 [10:59:56 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Because your mom.
