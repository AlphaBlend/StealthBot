 [08:09:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you should
 [08:09:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> add more of a delay to cb
 [08:09:25 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> hi eric
 [08:09:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> cb isn't delayed.
 [08:09:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hi, ninja.
 [08:09:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> well delay the ban
 [08:10:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> uh whyd you whisper that lol
 [08:10:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There isn't much more I can do, Jack.
 [08:10:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it should work pretty well if it did it like you said

 [08:11:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> how is the bot supposed to know who is going to respond to the command?
 [08:12:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That would work (up to 500ms), but the delay would be insane for other bots in the channel.
 [08:12:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> who cares

 [08:12:20 PM] <From The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> oh! okay good, cause I'm thinking it's time to show my support soon.
 [08:12:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> do like
 [08:12:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think I'm going to go back to a random delay.
 [08:12:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> 333 seconds or something
 [08:12:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you want some insanely high delay, script it.
