 [11:33:53 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> how do I create a packet in c++?
 [11:34:32 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> send().
 [11:34:56 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> But I'm trying to connect to battle.net.
 [11:35:05 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> And I'd need to connect on a gateway too
 [11:35:05 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> I don't get it.
 [11:35:10 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ugh
 [11:35:17 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Erm.
 [11:35:27 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> yes.
 [11:35:30 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> I'd like to know.
 [11:35:38 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You build the packet using an array.
 [11:35:40 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> send() only sends it
 [11:35:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Just store the dwords, words, bytes, etc.
 [11:35:56 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then send() away.
 [11:36:01 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> in wat array?
 [11:36:02 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> Vector, find a good C++ bot and use it for reference.
 [11:36:05 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> string array?
 [11:36:12 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You could use a char array.
 [11:36:17 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> David, I'm only going to try to connect using the simplest of methods.
 [11:36:24 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> D2DV
 [11:36:29 AM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> byte array?
 [11:36:38 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> how would I set that up?
 [11:36:42 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, a byte array would work as well.
 [11:36:44 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> byte var[]?
 [11:36:46 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> I'm still trying to figure out what's wrong with my 0x51 >_>
 [11:37:09 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Then how would it know it's DWORD from string?
 [11:37:24 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'd define the size based on the size you've permitted the socket to use.
 [11:37:25 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> I imagine that is implied.
 [11:37:29 AM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> do you even know what a DWORD is
 [11:37:40 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [11:37:42 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Explain me.
 [11:37:47 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> It's like a string.
 [11:37:51 AM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> do you know what a byte is
 [11:37:53 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> You're unexplainable. =\
 [11:37:56 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> a byte yes
 [11:37:58 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> 8 bits
 [11:38:04 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a 4-byte integer value.
 [11:38:10 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> hmm
 [11:38:23 AM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> dword = double word
 [11:38:37 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> in order words a DWORD would imply the platform, and product ID, among other information.
 [11:38:46 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> IX86 and D2DV, and so on.
 [11:38:51 AM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> dword is raw data
 [11:38:57 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Hmm.
 [11:38:59 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> ok
 [11:39:03 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> 68XI and VD2D ;P
 [11:39:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [11:39:11 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Why must they be reversed?
 [11:39:16 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Those are strings.
 [11:39:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> In a little-endian system, the memory is read from the lowest order bit to the highest.
 [11:39:50 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (DWORD)'IX86' becomes 68XI if you were to look at it as if it were a string.
 [11:40:51 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> David..that's probably the problem with your little 0x51 right there.
 [11:40:59 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ?
 [11:41:14 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> You were sending it as a string, and not a DWORD
 [11:41:32 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> Um...
 [11:41:41 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> I did it exactly as l2uthless did.

 [11:41:54 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>     InsertDWORD ID
 [11:41:56 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can send it as a backwards string without a terminating null character (colloquially known as an "NTString"), but this is an incorrect way of dealing with such data.
 [11:41:58 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>     InsertDWORD Value
 [11:42:02 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>     InsertDWORD &H0

 [11:42:14 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>     InsertNTString CDKeyOwner
 [11:42:17 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> My 0x50, the one with the platform and product ID's is fine..
 [11:42:22 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There is no such thing as a non-null terminated string.
 [11:42:31 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> Meh..
 [11:42:35 AM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [11:42:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It won't affect your connection.

 [12:08:22 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> "excellent.....   (turns off headlights)"
 [12:08:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Speaking of which, I think a lot of people underestimate natural selection.
 [12:08:40 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> I don't see
 [12:08:42 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> why 
 [12:08:52 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> People are against cloaning
 [12:08:55 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> cloning*
 [12:08:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Specifically, the cultural components of it.
 [12:09:00 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> I have a question that will rattle your minds.
 [12:09:05 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> doubt it
 [12:09:10 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> Speaking of natural selection.
 [12:09:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> transgenetics, hakr.
 [12:09:28 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> How can natural selection account for the evolution of the primordial soup?
 [12:09:39 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> The first bit of life?
 [12:09:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How do you mean?
 [12:09:43 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> It had to be random.
 [12:09:51 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> Say, the next step was amoebas
 [12:10:00 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> mutations may be random
 [12:10:02 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> How would primordial soup evolve into that?
 [12:10:03 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> but natural selection isn't
 [12:10:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, exactly.
 [12:10:20 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> Then it's like all life was mutant.
 [12:10:29 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> things mutate all the time
 [12:10:33 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> srs
 [12:10:33 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> its part of evolution
 [12:10:47 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> well
 [12:10:50 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> 99% of mutations would be deadly if they were chosen
 [12:10:52 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> the exe in the debug folder is gone
 [12:10:56 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> so I'm in luck
 [12:10:59 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> are deadly*
 [12:11:01 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> to the cell
 [12:11:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Which is why we don't typically see mutated cells.
 [12:11:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> at least, not to such an extreme extent.
 [12:12:02 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> if a branch of humans lived in dark caves for generations with no light
 [12:12:08 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> they would be dichromatic
 [12:12:16 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> and if they were brought into the light
 [12:12:34 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> and never mated with a trichromatic human, they would be dichromatic for a long time
 [12:12:38 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> and as for the promordal soup idea, when the 1celled organisms are created through the varios amino acids n such within that area,
 [12:12:40 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> but eventually, their vision would change
 [12:12:49 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> thus starts the competition for recources.
 [12:13:17 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> i should say "some" light
 [12:13:26 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> if they had zero light, they would be blind most likely
 [12:13:44 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> in order for them to have the upper hand, cells evolve, or mutate, into multicelled organimsm
 [12:14:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The interesting thing would be how mitosis grew into meiosis.  ;p
 [12:14:44 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Once you make that leap, evolution begins taking place at faster and faster rates.

 [12:15:32 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> the idea that fascinates me the most

 [12:16:02 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> Define

 [12:17:13 PM] <prone_to_change@Azeroth> Continue, plese.
 [12:17:33 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> when we talk about evolution, i'll give you the "earmuffs" signal next time
 [12:17:35 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> ;)
 [12:17:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> anyway, like in that article you referenced, define: Cultural evolution is what is speeding up the evolvement of humans.
 [12:18:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Our ability to transport humans from one side of the world to the other in a matter of hours, our desire to drink milk from cattle, etc.
 [12:18:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> our desire to be clean all of time.
 [12:18:35 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> yeah, i think another factor is the connection we can make to any part of the world
 [12:18:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Our overpopulated cities.
 [12:19:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> We have, in many ways, become the agents of our evolution.
 [12:19:21 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> for non domesticated animals, they have to mate with animals close
 [12:19:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The only thing we really have to compete with now are virii, and the diseases we're creating.
 [12:19:39 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> so north american animals mate with north american animals 
 [12:19:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> diabetes, heart problems, cancer.
 [12:20:00 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> yep
 [12:20:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> </3 massive availability of resources...
 [12:20:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then there's those that are still bound strongly to the old-world natural selection.
 [12:20:26 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> Kinda funny, the longer we live, the more desieses n stuff we find.
 [12:20:29 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> the fact that i could get on a plane and fly to japan, and mate with a woman there
 [12:20:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> i.e., those in Africa.
 [12:20:38 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> throws a whole new twist in evolution, i think
 [12:20:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [12:21:12 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> guys
 [12:21:18 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> this is a bit "off the wall"
 [12:21:20 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> but 
 [12:21:21 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Even without nano-tech immune systems, we're getting to the point where a single disease could wipe out the population.

 [1:20:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.

 [1:25:04 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> in the function you want

 [1:27:23 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> does that mean I should use if (e.KeyCode(13))?

 [6:20:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Isn't the fact that it's taking in place of the bot a notification that it's a bot-related error in and of itself?
 [6:20:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> or message, rather.

 [6:24:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... what else would you use?

 [6:25:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> sex.
 [6:26:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Windows sockets, or WinSock, is simply Windows' API interface for the socket implementation.
 [6:27:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> interface being a reduntant term in that phrase, but I'm sure you get what I'm stating.
 [6:28:44 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> Well, I got pretty much everything down with mine... I'm only having some problems with the Version Check that I have yet to resolve.

 [6:29:29 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> I don't think I have ever made a program that... didn't use a GUI..
 [6:29:55 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> in CS they teach more about data structure and theory and less about graphical stuff
 [6:30:05 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> so my extent of console apps stopped when i left college
 [6:30:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I hate how they focus on console applications...
 [6:31:02 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> yeah, they should do a bit of both
 [6:31:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's good informations, yes, but it's not something seen in real-world applications.
 [6:31:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I get sick of designing consoles... and when we finally have an assignment with a GUI, it's something like "place a text box on the screen that validates user input."

 [6:33:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> heh
 [6:34:04 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> at the university i went to, CS and SE were a difference of like 3 classes
 [6:34:17 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> 3 programming type classes, but CS had more math on top of that
 [6:34:22 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> so i chose cs
 [6:34:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> heh
 [6:35:03 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> i heard they have merged the two since ive been there now
 [6:35:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, SE, from what I understand of it, just focuses more on project development/management, rather than actual programming.
 [6:35:19 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> they were going to call it SECS (sex!)
 [6:35:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It doesn't generally make much sense to split them.
 [6:35:39 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> yeah
 [6:35:51 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> there are some boring classes in se
 [6:35:56 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> but i guess important
 [6:36:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Do you have any other certifications?  MSCE, etc.
 [6:36:19 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> programming models, blah blah
