 [2:57:36 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes?
 [2:57:37 PM] <Tech-PhiX> The bot's current trigger is " . " (Alt + 046)
 [2:57:42 PM] <Eric[nK]> 1337whoami
 [2:57:43 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> How does the bot figure out which commands get sent to battle.net and which don't?
 [2:57:43 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> Eric[nK] [Tech (group)] has access 90 and flags TOAJSo.
 [2:57:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> 1337rejoin

 [2:58:03 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> hdx.jbls.org and jbls.org get stuck on bnls connected, lol
 [2:58:15 PM] <Eric[nK]> The commands that have Battle.net commands as well also send data to Battle.net.
 [2:58:19 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's really pretty icky.
 [2:58:31 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> I know but like
 [2:58:32 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> like /whoami
 [2:58:34 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> ugh
 [2:58:36 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> lol
 [2:58:37 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> how is the bot able to parse
 [2:58:45 PM] <Berzerker-Tech>  /ver vs. /join
 [2:58:52 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> and know not to send info to B.net with the former.
 [2:59:02 PM] <Joe-Tech :: "I wish the world was a fly and I'm a giant rolled up newspaper." --Al Bundy :: Up 7 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes and 44 seconds>
 [2:59:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> When /join is parsed, it just sends the command to Battle.net.
 [2:59:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> When /ver is parsed, it isn't.
 [2:59:30 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> but how does it know
 [2:59:38 PM] <Berzerker-Tech> it checks the command?
 [2:59:40 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> If text - "/join" send ?
 [2:59:42 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> lol
 [2:59:49 PM] <Tech-PhiX> AI
 [2:59:50 PM] <Pyro6-Tech> =*
 [2:59:54 PM] <Eric[nK]> The command parser steals all of the messages.  When it finds a command that is internal, it calls it.  If the command does not exist the message is sent directly to Battle.net.
 [3:00:22 PM] <Eric[nK]> If a command exists, but is also a Battle.net command, the function that handles the command displays the result of the command and then sends the original message back to Battle.net.
 [3:00:42 PM] <Eric[nK]> If the command exists, but isn't a Battle.net command, the same process as above occurs, but no message is sent to Battle.net.
 [3:01:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> It doesn't know what to do besides what I tell it to do.
 [3:01:34 PM] <Eric[nK]> whoami is both an internal command, and a Battle.net command, so I've programmed the whoami function to send the message to Battle.net after internal parsing.
