 [03:47:07 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> where are you
 [03:47:18 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> definately not here
 [03:47:32 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Good
 [03:47:42 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> If you were here I would ask you 2 things
 [03:47:57 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> 1. What would I have to change in a config.ini to make it work on r3 (a beta config)
 [03:48:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> use r8!
 [03:48:26 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and uh
 [03:48:29 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> 2. If 2 bots load a plugin from the same folder will it sync variables
 [03:48:34 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> only SetBNLSServer to BNLSServer
 [03:48:40 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Ok, thanks
 [03:48:50 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I am trying to get a public variable
 [03:48:52 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> to sync
 [03:49:07 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> are the bots in the same folder?
 [03:49:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> or just the plugin
 [03:49:18 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> No i edited the plugin system to load a folder
 [03:49:28 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> then no
 [03:49:29 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> each bot will load from the same folder
 [03:49:34 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Why not

 [03:49:53 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> because variables aren't stored in the plugin file... lol
 [03:50:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> unless you did like
 [03:50:26 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> when you set the variable, it puts it in settings.ini
 [03:50:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and when you get it, it gets it from there
 [03:50:39 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and both bots use the same settings.ini file
 [03:50:45 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> it is not that type of variable
 [03:50:58 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> CreateObject("ADOR.Recordset")

 [07:41:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you read it.
 [07:41:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you go into c++
 [07:41:56 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> no
 [07:41:57 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> no really, i thought it was the base machine language.
 [07:41:58 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and you see atoi()
 [07:41:58 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> not any1
 [07:42:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and you'rel ike "WTF"
 [07:42:17 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> haha
 [07:42:20 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> function names aren't so easy to understand in c++
 [07:42:41 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> well
 [07:42:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> "CInt" and "atoi"
 [07:42:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ./me notes that atoi() is a C function, not a C++ function.
 [07:42:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can easily see the difference
 [07:42:55 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> would you lay off my case if i told you that i knew what atoi() was?

 [07:43:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can use printf() in C++; it doesn't mean that you should.

 [07:43:37 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> can you dig it
 [07:43:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> luc1fr you can google atoi but when you start writing code
 [07:43:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> cout << "hello world!!!! /me dies!" << endl;

 [07:44:15 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> ^exactly
 [07:44:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> exactly, and luc1fr can't figure out vbs
 [07:44:39 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> he told me he can tell me what atoi does, by googling most likely.
 [07:44:44 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> see, unlike most noobs. probably like you. I tend to dig until i find what i'm looking for.
 [07:44:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you dont think i try?
 [07:45:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> funny.
 [07:45:06 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> No, I've already read up on it. Doubt i would ever have a use for it though.
 [07:45:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you're not even making sense anymore
 [07:45:38 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> and your getting on my case for no fucking reason.
 [07:45:39 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Eric how old are you
 [07:45:43 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ;p
 [07:45:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if you're talking about not having any use for atoi() then you shouldn't even attempt C/C++

 [07:46:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> the first thing i said was 'not to be mean'

 [07:46:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you _tried_ learning vbs
 [07:46:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and you couldnt
 [07:46:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> now you're learning something harder?
 [07:46:36 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i didnt really try
 [07:46:44 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> that is the case.
 [07:46:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you're not going to "really try" c++ either
 [07:46:54 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> And, you know this how?
 [07:47:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> atoi() isn't used very often...
 [07:47:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you gave up on the easily language
 [07:47:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Static casting is generally better.

 [07:47:44 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> jack, i honestly dont care. you should know that by now.

 [08:06:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if you learn c++, you'll make a program that finds prime numbers or has a bank
 [08:06:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and be like "wow, now how can i really use this?"
 [08:07:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why are you learning a language? help you drive a truck?

 [08:08:14 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah, then i would probably kill my self.
 [08:08:25 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> or warn my brother about the symptoms.
 [08:08:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yea because you couldn't keep all the infromation in your head and drive a truck at the same time
