 [02:46:30 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> wc3 sucks
 [02:46:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [02:46:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not really
 [02:46:45 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> there is no latency bar at all
 [02:46:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There isn't supposed to be.
 [02:47:02 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> but there is one in SC
 [02:47:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> 0ms = 0 bars.
 [02:47:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There shouldn't be.
 [02:47:14 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> no
 [02:47:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> hes saying war3 doesn't care about ping at all eric
 [02:47:17 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> I mean for any user
 [02:47:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it shows clan tag instead of bars
 [02:47:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> oh.
 [02:47:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> which i don't really care what the users ping is if im playing
 [02:48:01 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> you will if that person lags the game
 [02:48:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> kick him!
 [02:48:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> With TCP, a user's latency is much less important.
 [02:48:14 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> you don't know who
 [02:48:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yes you do
 [02:48:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because it pops up
 [02:48:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> heh
 [02:48:30 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and says "waiting for username"
 [02:48:30 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> not always
 [02:48:34 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> there is somethign about that
 [02:48:46 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> sometimes it's just a constant lag
 [02:48:46 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> that person who is lagging sees the username as someone other than him
 [02:49:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> usually if you're the one lagging, you see everyones name
 [02:49:08 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> yeah
 [02:49:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but if im host, and i can kick people
 [02:49:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and i know im not the one lagging
 [02:49:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i dont care about peoples pings inbot either
 [02:49:42 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> id rather have it be a clan tag
 [02:49:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yarly
 [02:50:03 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> or ... numbers instead of bars
 [02:50:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I would like to do like Eternal Chat and display both.
 [02:50:28 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> and the numbers in the color the bars would have
 [02:50:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i say the bot displayed a "[TAG]" after the name in different color or something!
 [02:50:45 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> OR!!!!!
 [02:50:50 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> make an extra cloumn
 [02:50:52 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> you can hide
 [02:50:54 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> or show
 [02:50:55 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> as you wish
 [02:50:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> heh
 [02:50:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> or not lol
 [02:51:05 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> why not ...
 [02:51:28 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> you could do the same with ping
 [02:51:38 PM] <PhiX@Azeroth> so the user can decide what he wants to see in the channel list
 [02:51:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#648361](550) <tarheelcoxn> iank has trouble with English. his native language is Python | <iank> Yeah | <iank>   I'm forced | <iank>     To indent | <iank>   My sentences>
