 [03:41:41 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea, and what does the udt have that the cls doesnt that you cant use boh?

 [05:07:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it... still shouldnt be greyed out?
 [05:07:23 PM] <Eric[nK]> ...?
 [05:07:31 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can't rename users.
 [05:07:40 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if i double click them i can.
 [05:07:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> more of a triple click, but yea..
 [05:08:04 PM] <Eric[nK]> Have you done so in dev release 2?
 [05:08:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i just did.
 [05:08:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> User(s) found: Hero.B\50, 
 [05:08:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> User(s) found: Hero.C\50, 
 [05:09:00 PM] <Eric[nK]> I can't reproduce.
 [05:09:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> try to triple click a name
 [05:09:15 PM] <Eric[nK]> I suppose that could have been worded better, but anyway...
 [05:09:18 PM] <Eric[nK]> I did.
 [05:09:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and just.. wait a second
 [05:09:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> click very very fast ;p

 [05:10:03 PM] <Eric[nK]> ##ver; whois Hero.C
 [05:10:04 PM] <Pyro[BoT]@Azeroth> .: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Development Release 2 by Stealth.
 [05:10:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> .: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Development Release 2 by Stealth.
 [05:10:05 PM] <Pyro[BoT]@Azeroth> There was no such user found.
 [05:10:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Hero.C has access 50.
 [05:10:26 PM] <Eric[nK]> Strange.
 [05:10:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i just changed your name eric[nk] to Eric[nK]
 [05:11:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you still can't get it to rename by triple clicking?
 [05:12:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> ohh, I think I see.
 [05:12:48 PM] <Eric[nK]> It'll occur after you create an entry.  Otherwise, it won't work.
 [05:12:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> enable the renaming...
 [05:12:54 PM] <Eric[nK]> I'll fix that in a sec.
 [05:13:01 PM] <Eric[nK]> Why rename a user?
 [05:13:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i didn't create any entry...
 [05:13:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> Delete and create.
 [05:13:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because eric[nk] looks stupid and i migth want to name it Eric[nK]
 [05:13:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can delete and create groups too, why rename those??
 [05:14:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if it doesn't harm anything, and it works perfectly right now
 [05:14:20 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then why not?
 [05:14:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you don't need an extra button...
 [05:14:38 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> just enable the menu
 [05:14:51 PM] <Eric[nK]> Groups can contain a large number of other entries that would make deletions/additions tedious and complex. 
 [05:15:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> tedious? maybe
 [05:15:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> err 
 [05:15:31 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so then allow renaming for users only
 [05:15:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> complex? no
 [05:15:50 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if i delete a user and recreate
 [05:16:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i also delete all their info (rank, flags, create on, last edit) also
 [05:18:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so.. are you removing the renaming?
 [05:20:59 PM] <Eric[nK]> Generally, if you're renaming a user, you would want for all of the above to be removed anyway.
 [05:21:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> Because, generally, renaming a user is to completely change who the entry is for.
 [05:21:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> no...?
 [05:21:24 PM] <Eric[nK]> Hero.B -> Hero.C, for example.
 [05:21:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if my friend changes his name every week because he's an idiot
 [05:21:40 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i dont want to have his info deleted
 [05:21:59 PM] <Eric[nK]> Group entries, however, can maintain essentially the same "identity" if renamed to something different.
