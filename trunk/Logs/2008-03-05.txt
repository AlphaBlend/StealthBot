 [09:49:38 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth> PhiX
 [09:49:55 AM] <PhiX> I don't want the bot to trigger when there is an argument behind it
 [09:50:01 AM] <PhiX> e.g. .where bla
 [09:50:07 AM] <PhiX> shouldn't trigger .where

 [09:51:20 AM] <PhiX> the bot should only execute the internal command when there are no arguments
 [09:51:33 AM] <PhiX> since the command doesn't require any arguments
 [09:52:09 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> oh.

 [09:54:16 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm thinking about using my ValidateAccess() function, which is called before executing any command, to verify the command format using commands.xml.
 [09:55:28 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If I do that, I can fix a lot of the problems that seem to crop up because a specific command isn't correctly handling issues involving the usage of incorrect command syntax.
 [09:56:32 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I still don't know what to do about restrictions, though...
 [09:57:04 AM] <PhiX> btw
 [09:57:10 AM] <PhiX> the restrictions
 [09:57:25 AM] <PhiX> will they cover this issue as well? http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=31449
 [09:57:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I had thought about that, but there's no easy way to implement it.
 [09:58:00 AM] <PhiX> hm
 [09:58:25 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> *Technically* a restriction will provide a fix for that... I think... but it wouldn't exactly be recommended.
 [09:58:36 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think I'm giving restrictions too much power as is.

 [01:10:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Only display the message after the MessageSent comes back, and use the message as it is sent in MessageSent.

 [01:11:20 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> how would it be difficulty

 [01:11:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When a message is split up, it's still going to be given the same tag as it was assigned.  However, you'll now need to retrieve ... exactly.

 [01:12:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> how can i convert a dword to a string? o.o
 [01:12:16 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i can just have it use the message
 [01:12:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> BitConverter, Pyro.
 [01:12:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and leave the dictionary alone
 [01:12:30 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> sigh

 [01:45:32 PM] <OchO_CinCo[HoF]> another bot problem..
 [01:45:41 PM] <PhiX> @;;b OchO_CinCo[HoF]@USEast Banned emote phrase: help with bot
 [01:45:42 PM] OchO_CinCo[HoF] was banned by PhiX[BoT] (Banned emote phrase: help with bot).
 [01:45:42 PM] -- OchO_CinCo[HoF] has left the channel.
 [01:45:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The bigger issue, however, is providing a validating routine (in every function) to check overflow limits on variables.
 [01:45:53 PM] <PhiX> was that too obvious?
 [01:46:01 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but is the command processor called before the plugin system, or how would the plugin be able to validate using he restricition section
 [01:46:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>  [16:48:09.453] <From Bot-Vector> I wonder if the timers are built off the sleep() function in increments of 1000ms
 [01:46:06 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> .....
 [01:46:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's one of this issues I'm struggling with, Ribose.
 [01:46:20 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> .....
 [01:46:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> LOL.!
 [01:46:33 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ...
 [01:46:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Sleep() calls suspend the calling thread; obviously that's not how these timers set up.
 [01:48:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The plugin system, or even the internal command functions, shouldn't have to worry about dealing with restrictions.
 [01:48:37 PM] -- DarkMage2303@Azeroth [250ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 11, icon tier Human, rifleman icon, in Clan SNAP)
 [01:48:40 PM] -- DarkMage2303@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [01:48:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so... you should make an event_command
 [01:49:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It should be something dealt with by a single function that ensures proper formatting and access rules.
 [01:49:01 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> that calls the pluginsystem after dealing with commands.xml
 [01:49:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's what I was thinking, but I really don't like that idea.
 [01:49:28 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> what better idea you got?
 [01:49:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't know, yet.
 [01:50:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ... 
 [01:50:40 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ... isn't taht suggestion exactly what i was suggesting like 2 months ago
 [01:50:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, it is.
 [01:51:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This is different, though.
 [01:51:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> o.o lol and full circle we come and nothing has changed ;0
 [01:51:16 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> how so?
 [01:51:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> $ci snap
 [01:51:22 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth> Oh SnaP!! [snap] was created on March 4, 2008, has 10 members, and is currently under the command of DarkMage2303.
 [01:51:31 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> rofl noob
 [01:51:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This would give the bot much more power over which scripted commands are called and which aren't.
 [01:51:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> $ver
 [01:51:45 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth> .: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Development Release 2 by Stealth.
 [01:51:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's what I don't like about it.
 [01:52:23 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> if you wanna parse the command manually, you can just use event_usertalk and such
 [01:53:07 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth : Chuck Norris once rode a nine foot grizzly bear through an automatic car wash, instead of taking a shower.>
 [01:53:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> "manually" is something a scripter won't likely be able to do without internal functions for providing support.
 [01:53:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I can create those functions, but if I do so, there won't be much need for Event_Command().
 [01:58:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think IsCommand() will just provide automatic rank/flag & restriction checks.
 [01:59:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If (IsCommand(Username, Message).HasAccess) Then blah or something.
 [01:59:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Or a separate function: If HasAccess(Username, Command, Arguments)
 [02:00:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I kind of like such an idea: Then users won't really even have to worry about dealing with flags and ranks and such.
 [02:03:07 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth : The phrase 'balls to the wall' was originally conceived to describe Chuck Norris entering any building smaller than an aircraft hangar.>
 [02:09:01 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> then make a commands.add where commands is  the commands.xml control object that is made available like ssc and botvars are
