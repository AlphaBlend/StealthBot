 [5:54:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> hmm
 [5:54:29 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> Eric
 [5:54:39 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> there are 2 rejoin command blocks
 [5:54:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> ...?
 [5:54:48 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> and what is the difference between rejoin and resign?
 [5:54:54 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> in commands.xml
 [5:55:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> resign is a Battle.net command.
 [5:55:21 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> which has rejoin as alias
 [5:55:43 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> what is the SB command rejoin doing then?
 [5:56:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> The rejoin command simply sends the join channel packet to Battle.net with the current channel specified as the destination.
 [5:57:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> The /rj command uses Battle.net's /join command, as I'm sure you know.
 [5:57:19 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> does it?
 [5:57:22 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend has left the channel.
 [5:57:25 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend [94ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan SBs)
 [5:57:25 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend has acquired ops.
 [5:57:27 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend>  [02:58:14.735] -- Joined channel: Clan SBs --
 [5:57:41 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> when I use /j the same channel on the client I don't see me joining the channel
 [5:57:55 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> and I don't get another greet
 [5:58:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> huh?
 [5:58:53 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> what does SB do exactly when performing the /rejoin command
 [5:58:56 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> ?
 [5:59:14 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend>  [02:58:01.688] <Eric[nK]> The /rj command uses Battle.net's /join command, as I'm sure you know.
 [5:59:21 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> it doesn't join a different channel
 [5:59:33 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> only sometimes it joins "bot name Rejoin"
 [6:00:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> ./rejoin uses a special packet; /rj uses Battle.net's /join to join a different channel and return.
 [6:00:14 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> ah
 [6:00:20 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> but rj and rejoin are aliases
 [6:00:23 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> in SB
 [6:00:29 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend has left the channel.
 [6:00:33 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend [94ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan SBs)
 [6:00:33 PM] -- Tech-PhiX@Northrend has acquired ops.
 [6:00:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> They shouldn't be.
 [6:01:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> They are two separate commands (when issued from within the bot).
 [6:01:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Northrend> If issued from outside of the bot, rj and rejoin are equivalent.
 [6:01:16 PM] <Tech-PhiX@Northrend> maybe that's why you have two "rejoin" command blocks?
 [6:01:32 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Northrend> why would you need two commands
