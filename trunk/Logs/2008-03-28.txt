 [07:56:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> server info
 [07:56:14 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> 1.3 i think
 [07:56:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but didnt you say there was one just for kicks?
 [07:56:20 PM] <Alendar> I have 1.2
 [07:56:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i was gonna release it to the forums
 [07:56:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and forgot
 [07:56:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> uh no
 [07:56:40 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> 0x12 is for server infos
 [07:56:47 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and kicks come in the form of "server infos"
 [07:56:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yea i know
 [07:57:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but i thought you said there was another thing
 [07:57:02 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i said i wished there was a special one for kicks
 [07:57:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that just...
 [07:57:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> balbladfnafn
 [07:57:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> k so
 [07:57:19 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> jack
 [07:57:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i dont know anything about python
 [07:57:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yes VBScript
 [07:57:38 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> we spent many hours alone with mountain dew to figure out pyrobot
 [07:57:42 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> dont question our skillage
 [07:57:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i wasnt
 [07:57:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [07:58:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i thought he said there was a special one for kicks
 [07:58:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i was confsed
 [07:58:15 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> YOU THOUGHT WRONG
 [07:58:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> http://docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html
 [07:58:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> python has like
 [07:58:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> tons of useless functions
 [07:58:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ITS SO GREAT!
 [07:58:49 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> reminds me of the plugin system
 [07:58:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> no but
 [07:58:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> these are
 [07:59:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> like useful useless ones
 [07:59:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> where 
 [07:59:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> like 1 in 5000 scripts you might use one of these
 [07:59:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> isspace(      )
 [07:59:30 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>     Return true if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is at least one character, false otherwise.
 [07:59:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>     For 8-bit strings, this method is locale-dependent. 
 [07:59:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> like that is a good function
 [07:59:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> istitle(      )
 [07:59:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>     Return true if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one character, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters and lowercase characters only cased ones. Return false [more]
 [07:59:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> otherwise. 
 [07:59:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's a "wtf does that do" function
 [07:59:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> rofl
 [08:00:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#7885](1299) <Halcr0> If I had a knife, I'd shoot you>
 [08:00:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> python is like autoit
 [08:00:07 PM] <Alendar> David, do you ever play on your 360?
 [08:00:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why andy
 [08:00:14 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ues
 [08:00:17 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yes
 [08:00:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> autoit has a function for every part of windows that doesnt protect itself
 [08:00:31 PM] <Alendar> I need to get a 360.
 [08:00:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> like changing buttons in a form
 [08:00:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> or the title of a window
 [08:00:42 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you can hide windows
 [08:00:45 PM] <Alendar> I am really bored with my PS2.

 [08:08:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> http://rafb.net/p/Mqjhhz68.html
 [08:08:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> without looking past the first line
 [08:08:30 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> im guessing
 [08:08:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> .GetFolder(siPath).Files
 [08:08:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats erroring

 [08:09:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> remove the ".files" i think
 [08:09:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i looked at the plugin system
 [08:09:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> man you should use a dictionary...
 [08:09:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> whats 'si'?
 [08:10:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the mini chatbot im using
 [08:10:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#651467](405) * kafiend sets mode: -o kafiend | <kafiend> with beer comes great irresponsibility>

 [08:10:17 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> 2x*
 [08:10:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Replace(curFile, BotPath(), "")
 [08:10:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats erroring
 [08:10:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can put a class or an array in a dictionary
 [08:10:40 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> curfile is an object
 [08:10:43 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o
 [08:10:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> dur
 [08:10:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you cant do it like that
 [08:10:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [08:11:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if you put an array in a dictionary
 [08:11:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can do
 [08:11:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> dic.item("hmm")(0) or (1)
 [08:11:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> how can i get the filepath
 [08:11:40 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> then
 [08:12:16 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what do you mean
 [08:12:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the path to the file
 [08:12:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Set curFile = siFSO.OpenTextFile(File, 1)
 [08:12:26 PM] <FreeSlaves> User was not added because you do not have access to specified groups.
 [08:12:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> isnt 'file' the path?
 [08:12:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no
 [08:13:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if it was, it wouldnt error
 [08:13:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> or
 [08:13:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> wait
