 [12:21:59 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> woot
 [12:21:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How much did your UPS cost?

 [12:22:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Are you sure it's uninterruptable?
 [12:22:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yes..
 [12:22:39 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> or at least'
 [12:22:42 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> it says it is

 [12:23:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Because there's two types: one that supplies continuous power from a battery; and one that takes a few moments to switch over to battery power after the land line dies.
 [12:23:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The latter is cheaper.
 [12:24:01 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> well regardless
 [12:24:04 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its a piece of shit
 [12:24:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> An off-line UPS remains idle until a power failure occurs, and then switches from utility power to its own power source, almost instantaneously. An on-line UPS continuously powers the protected load from its [more]
 [12:24:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> reserves (usually lead-acid batteries or stored
 [12:24:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> kinetic energy), while simultaneously replenishing the reserves from the AC power.
 [12:24:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The on-line type of UPS, in addition to providing protection against complete failure of the utility supply, provides protection against all common power problems, and for this reason it is also known as a power [more]

 [12:24:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply
 [12:24:58 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yea

 [12:25:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> FUCK
 [12:25:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, it won't *always* fail to come on in an adequate period of time.
 [12:25:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> where can i download the newest patch for war3
 [12:25:48 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> for which server..?
 [12:26:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> electronic devices can incur a *temporary* loss of power and remain fully functional.
 [12:26:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> huh
 [12:26:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (like your computer that remained on without UPS)
 [12:26:22 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its usually the one that goes off
 [12:26:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The time is miniscule, though.
 [12:26:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> 100 microseconds, IIRC.

 [05:11:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> how should i do it eric
 [05:11:54 PM] <PhiX> @;;help add
 [05:11:55 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> [add (aliases: set)]: creates or modifies a specified database entry. (Syntax: <trigger>add <username> [rank] [attributes]).  Requires 20 access or flags A, or a.
 [05:12:04 PM] <PhiX> @;;help rem
 [05:12:05 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> [rem (aliases: del)]: removes a specified user from the bot's database. (Syntax: <trigger>rem).  Requires 80 access or flags A, or a.
 [05:12:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ban a user and come back with another CD-Key.
 [05:12:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> oh thats noob
 [05:12:30 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> old ban evasion was better
 [05:12:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You now have access to the banlist.  If you don't like it, script it.
 [05:13:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why remove things from stealthbot ?
 [05:13:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It only worked as it did before due to a bug.
 [05:13:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not a bug if it worked correctly :)
 [05:13:51 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#11232](-9) <Karma> brb bathroom... | <DasAJ> we dont call the toilet a bathroom | <DasAJ> ever tried bathing in the toilet? | <SaladInc> there's a bath in the room though | <DasAJ> not here | <DasAJ> [more]>

 [05:14:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Dockers' 'jobs for life' scrapped
 [05:14:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It was a bug.  It doesn't matter if it was working correctly as you saw fit.
 [05:14:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It wasn't working correctly, period.
 [05:14:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The banlist was retaining bans for users even after they had been unbanned.
 [05:14:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> how do you know how it was supposed to work? ;o
 [05:15:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that ban evasion has probably been in stealthbot for mutliple versions
 [05:15:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and nobody complained about a "bug"
 [05:15:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Create a script: "enhanced ban evasion" or what have ya.
 [05:15:50 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> doesn't work the same because not all ops will have the script
 [05:16:09 PM] <PhiX> @;;help invite
 [05:16:09 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> [invite (aliases: none)]: invites a specified user into the clan in which the bot is a member. (Syntax: <trigger>invite).  Command is only available to the console.
 [05:16:14 PM] <PhiX> why console only?
 [05:16:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i think all clan commands are console only
 [05:16:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It wouldn't matter unless you took the trouble to get all of the bots on the same server; and if you took the trouble to do so, then you obviously can take the trouble to download a small script.
 [05:16:41 PM] <PhiX> invite has been in SB like forever though
 [05:16:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> besides .c
 [05:16:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, all of the clan commands are console only.
 [05:16:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> trouble of all bots on same server?
 [05:16:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's not hard
 [05:17:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>  ops, setserver
 [05:17:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  ops, add user blah b
 [05:17:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [05:17:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's shitlist
 [05:17:44 PM] <PhiX> @;;help createclan
 [05:17:44 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> [createclan (aliases: none)]: ... (Syntax: <trigger>createclan).  Command is only available to the console.
 [05:17:46 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not ban evasion
 [05:17:51 PM] <PhiX> does it work already?
 [05:17:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no, phix.
 [05:18:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why would you need to repeatedly ban a user, but only for a limited period of time, a time in which no one has any real control over?
 [05:18:25 PM] <PhiX> --help disbandclan
 [05:18:26 PM] <WWWW-Chief@Azeroth> [disbandclan (aliases: none)]: ... (Syntax: <trigger>disbandclan).  Requires 100 access or flags C.
 [05:18:50 PM] <PhiX> --help makechief
 [05:18:50 PM] <WWWW-Chief@Azeroth> [makechieftain (aliases: makechief)]: ... (Syntax: <trigger>makechieftain).  Requires 100 access or flags C.
 [05:18:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ban evasion (as i remember) worked like this:
 [05:18:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> user is banned
 [05:19:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and user keeps getting banned
 [05:19:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> until bot sees the server message "user has been unbanned"
 [05:19:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that would mean, someone unbanned him manually
 [05:19:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> which makes sense.
 [05:19:58 PM] -- Alendar [16ms] has joined the channel using Diablo II (Open Character).
 [05:19:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, but due to a bug, the unbans had to come specifically from the user that issued the ban.
 [05:20:02 PM] <PhiX> ddp also erases the banlists of all ops
 [05:20:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They also won't work correctly, period, due to Battle.net's name glitch.
 [05:20:50 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if nobody reported this "bug" as a bug, then people must of liked it and or thought it was a feature
 [05:20:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The name glitch will cause all kinds of issues with that.
 [05:21:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> which, it was a nice feature
 [05:21:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> In fact, in the next release, I believe, by default, SB will only store bans from the current user.
 [05:21:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That way, the ban list won't become contaminated by those that don't understand the glicth.
 [05:21:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> glitch*

 [05:23:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so by default it should be on
 [05:23:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> rarely?

 [06:24:34 PM] <idiat> hi idabot
 [06:24:38 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> this wasn't math, it's Municipal; we're calculating how much water an open channel can carry at a certain velocity
 [06:24:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make a uptime command in release 3
 [06:24:46 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> well it's kinda math
 [06:24:54 PM] <idiat> ok idobot
 [06:25:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ok
 [06:25:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> calculating = math :)
 [06:25:16 PM] <idiat> i should make a list of the stuff you say
 [06:25:18 PM] <idiat> so i remember it
 [06:25:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ya probably
 [06:25:40 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> so like, if you have a certain sized pipe and the water is going so fast, you can calculate the minimum amount of water needed to keep the velocity where it is
 [06:25:44 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> it's pretty cool

 [06:30:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> built into windows after you download and install it...
 [06:30:57 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> yeah
 [06:31:02 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> IdleBoT, or after you install Vista.
 [06:31:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> im pretty sure i installed .net on my vista too
 [06:31:17 PM] <idiat> or windows 7
 [06:31:26 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I'm pretty sure I didn't, IdleBoT.
 [06:31:34 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Maybe .NET 3
 [06:31:37 PM] <idiat> the fact that you are married only proves you're my best friend
 [06:31:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i got vista right when it came out
 [06:31:38 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Not .NET 2.
 [06:31:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so it probably had an old version
 [06:31:53 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I think I installed RTM. I don't know.
 [06:31:55 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> so like...i was installing autocad a while ago, and it was looking for the latest .NET framework, i'm guessing autocad uses some of that language then?

 [07:29:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> nah
 [07:29:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> there is like a big space between the tag and the side of the bot
 [07:29:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There has to be.
 [07:29:15 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and even the long tag doesnt go in that space
 [07:29:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> its easier to read the ping like that than to wait a second just for the tooltip to popup
 [07:29:22 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> why?
 [07:29:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Once the scroll bar pops up, the list expands.
 [07:29:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's *always* been that way.

 [08:17:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's why you only see him active on the forum for a two week period, followed by a several month leave.
 [08:17:52 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK], I've been hounding Stealth for that code for years and FINALLY saw it yesterday. And made a bugfix.
 [08:18:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's why when he was at a fucking party, he was looking at source code.
 [08:18:07 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> a pointless bug fix
 [08:18:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's not hard to find bugs in a program as large as StealthBot.
 [08:18:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It was a minor fix, to say the most.
 [08:18:23 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> I don't actually have VS6 installed but if Joe becomes a developer can I join too?
 [08:18:27 PM] <Alendar is currently: Bored Current Project: IRC Client My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [08:18:30 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> How often is that code called, anyhow Eric?
 [08:18:38 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> EVERY 5 SECONDS
 [08:18:47 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Naivete, it's up to Stealth, not Eric.
 [08:18:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> minor is still too much to say for that "bug"
 [08:18:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can't fix something that wasnt broken
 [08:18:55 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> no...

 [08:19:50 PM] -- Warrior.@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [08:19:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What Stealth and I need to do is to start componentizing it.
 [08:20:03 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> and the reason I was looking at the code is cause Andy was showing me all the old parts of it. For example, the packet logs in the trunk folder from when he was working on implementing WC3.
 [08:20:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> compartmentalize, rather.
 [08:20:38 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> you should make a CLI for stealthbot, i would use that
 [08:20:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If we were to separate the connection into a distinct independently updateable unit, we could make updates to the connection routines without actually having to require a release.
 [08:20:57 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Naivete, you should make a CLI for Windows, you'd be famous.

 [08:21:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> We could also assign specific developers to the project without giving them access to the rest of the source.
 [08:21:28 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> that would be awesome

 [08:21:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> NO ME MARY!
 [08:22:03 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> FUCK OFF I CALLED IT
 [08:22:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> NO
 [08:22:26 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> fine i'll make my own game
 [08:22:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Joe: With compartmentalization, you obviously narrow down the areas in which a bug must lie.
