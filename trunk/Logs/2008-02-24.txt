 [03:42:03 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> .
 [03:42:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, a priority queueing system is in the works; friends messaging won't be given a high priority, but all messages through the bot will be given a higher priority than command responses.
 [03:42:09 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> LOL, you funny Cam
 [03:42:18 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh?

 [03:42:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You could use a script to give specifically friends messages an even higher priority if you were to wish.
 [03:42:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So
 [03:42:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's almost done as of now.
 [03:42:49 PM] -- XiAoYaO8FaNg@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [03:42:53 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> nice.
 [03:43:05 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> HOw would I do that?
 [03:43:41 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Use %1, %2, and so on for usernames. The %rest argument can be any word/string/sentence after the %<number> variables have been filled with a string.
 [03:43:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'd handle the enter command through scripting, simply sending the friends command again using AddQ Message, Priority.
 [03:44:14 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh.
 [03:44:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There was already a similar system in place, but it was only half-functional, and didn't exactly meet the criteria for a prioritizing queue.
 [03:44:57 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Command is where the bot uses it's own queuing system. But AddQ, given certain command functions, can be variable in terms of how long a message stays in the queue?
 [03:45:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The new system *will* also implement a scheduling mechanism similar to an operating system to prevent a single user from monopolizing the queue.
 [03:45:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> oh my gosh.
 [03:45:59 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> This will be spread out to multiple stealthbots running on the system?
 [03:46:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no, multiple command responses in a queue.
 [03:46:19 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> oh.
 [03:46:24 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I see.
 [03:46:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If several users issue a find *, for example, each user will receive the first message, then each user will receive the second message, etc. in that order.
 [03:47:16 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh, nice.
 [03:47:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That way, the bot is delivering its information in a more usable way.
 [03:47:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Isn't that how it works currently?
 [03:47:52 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> !say .find *

 [03:48:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I've never heard of a bot handle a queue in the way in which I'm describing.
 [03:48:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a quite unique idea and I'm anxious to see if it works in a typical environment.
 [03:48:56 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Referring to this:  [3:49:09 PM] <Eric[nK]> If several users issue a find *, for example, each user will receive the first message, then each user will receive the second message, etc. in that order.

 [07:20:28 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> gnome
 [07:20:46 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> scratch that
 [07:20:58 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> find out how to fix the problem with pyrobot, then gnome
 [07:22:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> uhh
 [07:22:16 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i get a load call error
 [07:22:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ad nothing is in the load sub
 [07:22:22 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ..
 [07:22:25 PM] -- VBScript@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [07:22:25 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> o.o
 [07:22:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hmm
 [07:22:33 PM] -- VBScript@Azeroth [63ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.

 [07:22:33 PM] -- Stats updated: VBScript@Azeroth [63ms] is using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [07:22:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> maybe eric would know how to keep packets from getting stuck together when they are sent o.o
 [07:23:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... I told you before.
 [07:23:08 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i know
 [07:23:12 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but it... didnt work
 [07:23:14 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> o.o
 [07:23:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> TCP/IP is a streaming protocol; you can't keep them from streaming.
 [07:23:31 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> so how come stealthbot doesnt do it
 [07:23:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There are no "packets" in TCP.  There are only streams.
 [07:24:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> using the exact same process in vb6.. worked... when we did it in vb.net, it failed
 [07:24:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i know they are different
 [07:24:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Client protocols built on top of TCP/IP often create their own headers.  They do this to identify two differing segments of data.
 [07:24:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but i used the same winsock ...
 [07:24:38 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats why it doesnt work eric,
 [07:24:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> IT JUST DOESNT MAKE SENSE
 [07:24:44 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net does this as well.  Battle.net headers also include a length indicator.
 [07:24:48 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> sending 0x01 in the beginning doesnt have a header
 [07:25:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You just split up the message based on the length specified in the header.
 [07:25:30 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> split it up with what?
 [07:25:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'll have to buffer the data until an entire packet is received (packets will often times be split up into multiple streams).
 [07:25:55 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> nvm that
 [07:26:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Questions?
 [07:26:16 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yeah.....
 [07:26:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ...how?
 [07:26:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o.o
 [07:26:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How what?
 [07:26:28 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you cant send anything
 [07:26:29 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> in between
 [07:26:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> to break it
 [07:26:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can "break it" using the length of the packet specified by Battle.net.
 [07:27:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [07:27:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it's just a lone byte
 [07:27:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> 0x01
 [07:27:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the one you send in the beginning
 [07:27:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What is?
 [07:27:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes... and?
 [07:27:31 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> winsock combines it with the first packet
 [07:27:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So?
 [07:27:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the server kicks you off because that isn't the right length
 [07:27:46 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so you get ip banned..
 [07:28:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> when you look at the debugs compared to stealthbot
 [07:28:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net knows it's packet header is 1 byte in length.  That's not your problem here.
 [07:28:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> err, it's protocol identifier is 1 byte in length*
 [07:28:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The problem is elsewhere.
 [07:28:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i know
 [07:28:43 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> the problem is when we send it
 [07:28:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> malformed SID_AUTH_INFO I suppose.
 [07:29:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> or bad packet header.
 [07:29:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> winsock sends the protocol id and sid_auth_info together
 [07:29:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [07:28:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net knows it's packet header is 1 byte in length.  That's not your problem here.
 [07:29:21 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> k then
 [07:29:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> TCP is a streaming protocol: Your data is almost always sent together.
 [07:29:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can disable the nagel algorithm to correct that, but it doesn't matter either way.
 [07:30:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> TCP was meant to do exactly that for performance reasons.
 [07:30:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then idk what the fuck is wrong
 [07:30:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Your problem is either with your packet header or the formation of your SID_AUTH_INFO packet.
 [07:31:01 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> protocol id = &H0
 [07:31:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> platform id = &H49583836

 [07:44:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Your's *should* be identicial to the clients.
 [07:44:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, in the case of SID_AUTH_INFO, you can use different information.
 [07:44:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> oh
 [07:44:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The size should be exactly the same, though.
 [07:45:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If they are of different lengths, you're probably doing something wrong somewhere.
 [07:45:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the only difference is the middle
 [07:45:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but
 [07:45:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats because we ommited ours
 [07:45:41 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ya... refresh. i circled some of the differences

 [07:48:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> is it counting it
 [07:48:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o.o
 [07:48:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> thanks
 [07:48:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> no
 [07:48:58 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> because the length byte is based of the buffer, which 0x01 isnt added to
 [07:49:14 PM] -- HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [07:49:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's not the "length" in the packet header that's incorrect.
 [07:49:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's the formation of the packet.
 [07:49:46 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> uh
 [07:49:52 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i thought the lengths would be the same?
 [07:50:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They should be the same.  They aren't the same because you're sending something extra in SID_AUTH_INFO.
 [07:50:28 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> we know that
 [07:50:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> look at the size of the packet that was reported by the packet header.
 [07:50:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> packet logger*
 [07:50:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> 60
 [07:50:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> 60 - 1 for the protocol header, so 59.
 [07:51:03 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and sb is 58
 [07:51:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That corresponds to the packet length in the header.
 [07:51:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> pyro.
 [07:51:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> try running it back through the inbound buffer
 [07:51:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you want, you can paste the code here (or on AIM) and I can take a look.
 [07:51:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and see if the values are the same
 [07:53:20 PM] -- ActiveR@Azeroth [109ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon)

 [09:27:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Lets see if I can rid dev release 2 of any significant errors.
 [09:27:56 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> wanna get in... eat some candy?
 [09:28:12 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> we'll just find more ;o
 [09:28:21 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> it's not fun anymore finding errors
 [09:28:22 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> it
 [09:28:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I've almost finished the database manager, and that seems to be where a lot of them are coming from.

 [09:29:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think that may be due to a media player problem that should be corrected now.
 [09:29:31 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> you need to add a new secret command to make bots drop 
 [09:29:39 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> and then make that account expire
 [09:29:56 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> and let kids run around saying the secret command
 [09:30:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ./jack
 [09:30:43 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> sixens problem might also be media issues 
 [09:30:44 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> =/

 [09:37:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's backwards-compatible with the old method.
 [09:37:38 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> k
 [09:37:50 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> thats something new with dev2 right?
 [09:37:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [09:38:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's all for my IsCommand().
 [09:38:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [09:38:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> <3 IsCommand().
 [09:38:40 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> you need to add ssc functions
 [09:38:44 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> to edit the commands.xml
 [09:38:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's next.
 [09:39:03 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> using vbs would be too hard (can you use the xml object?) and it takes too long by hand
 [09:39:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> IsCommand() is going to allow you to access the commands.xml for reading.
 [09:39:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'll also add similar support for writing.
 [09:39:14 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> what about writing??
 [09:39:23 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> k
 [09:39:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> reading is no fun if you don't have any way of writing.

 [09:40:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The idea is to move users away from the plugin system help format and to also provide a standardized way of controling plugin access settings.

 [09:40:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So, of course, I have to give scripters the ability to add commands to commands.xml.
 [09:41:06 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth>  [11:41:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> reading is no fun if you don't have any way of writing.
 [09:41:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> help documentation, restrictions, general access settings.
 [09:41:10 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> tell that to a guy with no arms
 [09:41:18 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> well, no hands*
 [09:41:32 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> aliases...?
 [09:41:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, aliases as well.
 [09:42:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'd imagine that's why they're giving those that have been paralyzed the ability to move a mouse with their thoughts.
 [09:42:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Soon, they'll be able to write as well.  ;p
 [09:43:53 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> nah, most are using voice reconition(yes it's spelled wrong)
 [09:43:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [09:44:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That works as well.
 [09:44:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The concept is meant to allow for the eventual control over bionic implants.
 [09:47:51 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> or for kids to have fun getting the computer to type funny things
 [09:48:17 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> make a weird noise and see what it types out
