 [11:51:01 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> yay
 [11:51:05 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hmmk.
 [11:51:06 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> was it swents fault?
 [11:51:09 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> RemoveLines() is screwing me up.
 [11:51:31 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> what does removelines do
 [11:51:41 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It removes lines... duh?
 [11:51:47 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> yes but which lines
 [11:51:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It removes duplicate entries from the queue.
 [11:51:58 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> clsQueue.RemoveLines().
 [11:52:04 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> wouldn't it be smarter to not remove the lines
 [11:52:09 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> but not add them all together
 [11:52:23 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> so check before adding them to the queue?
 [11:52:32 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's essentially the same concept.
 [11:52:40 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> but ones easier.
 [11:52:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> not really.
 [11:52:50 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> yarly
 [11:53:03 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> you don't have to mess with arrays and whatnot trying to remove the line
 [11:53:07 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Considering that I also have to use the function to remove bans from other users... it's fine.
 [11:53:39 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a necessary function.
 [11:53:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> dummy!
 [11:54:00 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> the function is, but not the way your doing it ;o

 [11:58:46 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> does it remove everyline thats the same
 [11:58:53 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> or... just removes lines that are in a row

 [11:59:12 AM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> a

 [12:01:02 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> a
 [12:01:12 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> shouldn't it remove the last ones
 [12:01:13 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> and not the first ones?
 [12:01:23 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> http://rafb.net/p/Fe6lFa92.html say i pasted that
 [12:01:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I agree.  It isn't complete.

 [04:48:43 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> this aattachment is going to take awhile to upload
 [04:49:13 PM] Added mail for bob.
 [04:49:18 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> why dont you just make a quick and easy mail system
 [04:49:34 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> anything is probably better than that mail.dat file..
 [04:49:47 PM] Added mail for PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth.
 [04:50:25 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> whens the last time stealth has worked on the bot
 [04:50:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Stealth doesn't work on the project.
 [04:50:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's just Swent an I, essentially.
 [04:50:58 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> i dont think this upload is going to work
 [04:51:00 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> lol@swent
 [04:51:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you should suggest stealth add/remove developers
 [04:51:18 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> particularly add
 [04:51:21 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> why is snap even a dev?
 [04:53:03 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> just do /exec for i = 1 to 50000: command "hi", "/bmail someusername this is a message", false: next
 [04:53:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why add?
 [04:53:23 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> this upload isnt working
 [04:53:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> well if there are only two active devs
 [04:53:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's better that way.
 [04:53:45 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> not really
 [04:53:48 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> one dev fixes the bot
 [04:53:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I would have preferred it if it were just me from the beginning.
 [04:53:53 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> the other dev... gives the bots errors
 [04:53:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, exactly.
 [04:54:00 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [04:54:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I have to correct everyone's... changes.
 [04:54:12 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ... and resolves random topics in the beta forum, dont forget that
 [04:54:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Look at Hdx, for example.
 [04:54:18 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> and everyone=swent
 [04:54:19 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> rofl
 [04:54:34 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> seriously though
 [04:54:39 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> i would at least test what i change though >_>
 [04:54:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Hdx added that entire form system (bugging) and then just left.
 [04:54:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> how can you not notice that the plugin menu isnt working?
 [04:54:44 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then Swent...
 [04:54:49 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> "The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading." wow
 [04:54:57 PM] <IdleBot@Azeroth> im glad i waited 10 mins for that upload
 [04:55:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
