 [03:48:37 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> wrong*
 [03:48:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> why
 [03:49:09 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> also get the irc_error(blahblahblah) method handled

 [03:50:14 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> <3 you ribose

 [03:50:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> h
 [03:50:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> now i gotta write the protocol

 [03:52:19 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> because close is a keyword in vb6
 [03:52:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> whats his name mean
 [03:52:33 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> whats a suct
 [03:52:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> will Disconnect fire
 [03:52:40 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> when it is disconnected
 [03:52:43 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> or it will pass to winsock error
 [03:53:06 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> no, disconnect is just added in there to NOT fire ... of course it should fire
 [03:53:19 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> wait
 [03:53:27 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> the event is prefix_wsClose()
 [03:53:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> gotcha
 [03:53:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and that will occur even when using .WSClose?
 [03:54:11 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> servererror is onlky used by stealthbot because someone didn't want a whole new scripting event for disconnecting
 [03:54:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> idk, but i would assume so
 [03:54:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it has the same behavior as an actual winsock object
 [03:55:14 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so whatever the actual winsock object used in your vb6 network app does, this should do
 [03:55:35 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> because, actually the code looks something like this

 [03:56:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea
 [03:57:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> im gonna work on this then
 [03:57:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i should've added a packet buffer and shit
 [03:57:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ill be sure to share it with you when im finished
 [03:57:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> >.>
 [03:57:16 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but i'll just do that in a plugin
 [03:57:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> a buffer would be nice
 [03:57:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but not entirely necessary
 [03:57:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you dont really need one for irc unless you care about motd accuracy

 [03:58:05 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> hero, wth are you doing
 [03:58:17 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Making my plugin have sexy addchats ?
 [03:58:34 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i am making a Class clsWinsock for control over the object, with control as to be able to send text packets (irc-like protocols) or binary packets
 [03:58:45 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> mmm
 [03:58:47 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> with packet buffers and shit for the binary part
 [03:59:24 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and when the class initialized, all the downloading, registering, and setting up the winsock object is done
 [03:59:32 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> if the object isn't createable
 [03:59:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you should add bit conversions then
 [03:59:40 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> because they're not all in vbs
 [03:59:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> as easy to use as in the bigger languages
 [03:59:48 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> anyway
 [03:59:48 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> bit conversions?
 [03:59:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> long-> byte array
 [04:00:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> string -> byte array
 [04:00:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> etc
 [04:00:07 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> um, ew ;p
 [04:00:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> dont tell that to eric
 [04:00:15 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o.o
 [04:00:16 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but it does have things like
 [04:00:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> SendBuffer_String("blah") adds blah and a null terminator to the send buffer
 [04:01:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> RecvBuffer_String() which returns a string in the recv buffer until it reaches a null terminator or the end of the buffer
 [04:02:05 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> most of the stuff in the packet buffer is already in the BotNet plugin to control packets and stuff
 [04:02:32 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i'm just taking it out and making botnet smaller, and my plugin system a little more modular 
 [04:02:45 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> with one winsock plugin and many plugins that use it
 [04:03:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> of course, how would i make botnet know if winsock.plug is there as swent puts mopre of the ps inside the stealthbot source

 [04:17:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> oh nice job never fixing that safelist bypass =]
 [04:17:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> If you rely on a string buffer, you leave yourself open to your language's string handling "features."
 [04:17:57 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> #k Ribose@Azeroth
 [04:17:57 PM] Ribose was kicked out of the channel by Pyro[BoT].
 [04:17:57 PM] -- Ribose@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [04:17:59 PM] -- Ribose@Azeroth [31ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [04:18:27 PM] <Eric[nK]> raw data should always be sent as such.
 [04:18:28 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> what do you mean
 [04:18:38 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> where
 [04:19:11 PM] <Eric[nK]> Well, for instance, when Pyro and VBScript were working on data buffer in .NET, they discovered that the buffer was distorting their data.
 [04:19:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i do have functions to add stuff to the buffer without the null
 [04:19:47 PM] <Eric[nK]> This is because .NET's strings are all based on Unicode, so when data is stored, it is automatically converted to the respective form.
 [04:19:51 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> are you saying i should make functions to not even cstr() it before sending to winsock?
 [04:19:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> This prevented them from sending data correctly.
 [04:19:58 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea, so?
 [04:20:18 PM] <Eric[nK]> You should never send non-string data as a string.
 [04:20:21 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's just... silly.
 [04:20:37 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its playing telephone with data
 [04:20:39 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> this is vbs to vb6's winsock, which i'm pretty sure both are the same string control
 [04:20:40 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you make it a string
 [04:20:43 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it changes a bit
 [04:20:46 PM] -- NJJ@Azeroth [62ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 23, icon tier Tournament, Felguard icon, in Clan NJJ)
 [04:20:48 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you make it a byte again
 [04:20:50 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it changes a bit
 [04:20:51 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and in the end
 [04:20:56 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you have something like it
 [04:20:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> I've had to redo StealthBot's packet buffer recently because it wouldn't allow me to send UTF-8 because it stored raw data in a string.
 [04:20:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but it isnt the same
 [04:21:46 PM] <Eric[nK]> If you're using Visual Basic 6, it isn't a huge deal, but any .NET language would make such a buffer almost unusable.
 [04:21:46 PM] -- NJJ@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [04:21:58 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i'm not using a .net though -.-
 [04:22:03 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> so dont hound m,e
 [04:22:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> With Visual Basic 6, you just limit yourself to non-Unicode text.
 [04:22:29 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i would figure its a little different in .net, where everything was reconstructed
 [04:22:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> what kind of text would be unicode?
 [04:22:52 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> that it couldnt store
 [04:23:21 PM] <Eric[nK]> anything with a character code > 127
 [04:23:23 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> my foots numb, and it feels like its not my foot
 [04:23:45 PM] <Eric[nK]> oh, sorry, > 128.
 [04:23:56 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> 
 [04:24:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats hot
 [04:24:02 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> 
 [04:24:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> im in #stealthbot with a stealthbot
 [04:24:11 PM] <Eric[nK]> .NET would convert any such character into it's two-byte Unicode equivalent.
 [04:24:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [04:24:20 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i have already been in there
 [04:24:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> your slow xP
 [04:24:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> he got the beta two days ago
 [04:24:44 PM] <Eric[nK]> Technically, Visual Basic 6 does the same thing: It just hides this tid-bit of information from the user and you never notice it as such.
 [04:24:48 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and how long did it take you to make an irc plugin after you got the beta?
 [04:24:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yea, thats what i thought
 [04:25:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> on the offensive
 [04:25:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o.o
 [04:25:22 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> freenode doesn't make use of PING/PONG
 [04:25:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ?
 [04:25:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> wait eric, you mean anything like chr(129) is unicode and wouldn't work if i did SendBuffer_String(Chr(129)) ?
 [04:25:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> It wouldn't work on .NET.
 [04:25:38 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> or are you talking signed character code
 [04:25:44 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> 
 [04:25:54 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and you actually mean unsigned char code chr(255)
 [04:26:18 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ÿ
 [04:26:24 PM] <Eric[nK]> The Chr() function isn't Unicode-based.
 [04:26:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's just referencing your selected character-set.
 [04:27:08 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can use ChrW() to retrieve UTF-16/Unicode characters.
 [04:27:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> how on earth would i even add a unicode char to a string then (about 128)
 [04:27:18 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> oh
 [04:27:23 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i never use chrw
 [04:27:34 PM] <Eric[nK]> Have you ever used your system's character map program?
 [04:27:40 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> (
 [04:27:42 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea
 [04:27:49 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ÿ
 [04:27:52 PM] <Eric[nK]> Unicode supports every single character listed there.
 [04:28:13 PM] <Eric[nK]> You, however, will limit yourself to your system's default code page which only has 256 characters.
 [04:28:58 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> how would i send to winsock such a unicode char thats not on that page
 [04:29:32 PM] <Eric[nK]> You could either change your selected code page or abandon your data buffering solution for an array of bytes.
 [04:30:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ?
 [04:30:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ...
 [04:31:15 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> wait
 [04:31:17 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> um
 [04:31:39 PM] -- ClanGnome@Azeroth [47ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan Spht)

 [04:31:43 PM] -- ClanGnome@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [04:31:58 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> calling winsock.senddata with something other than a string would allow me to send such unicode?
 [04:32:03 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> because
 [04:32:15 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i just copied a char from that map into my send box, and it made it a ?, so working with vb6, i see no way i could even send such a char to test =/
 [04:33:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and then other users using vb6 couldn't see the unicode either because the vb6 control would make it a ? too
