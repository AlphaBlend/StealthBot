 [11:22:54 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric.
 [11:22:59 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I made a suggestion yesterday.
 [11:23:00 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hi
 [11:23:04 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Did you hear it?
 [11:23:34 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> oh BTW I was testing the realm capability in the beta.
 [11:23:37 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Works nice.
 [11:23:45 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> What was the problem in 2.6r3?
 [11:24:27 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't discuss beta-related issues with non-beta testers.
 [11:24:39 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm sure that you're well aware of that by now.
 [11:25:12 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yeah, but I'm speaking in conjunction with the problem in 2.6r3
 [11:25:36 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Unless that falls in the category of talking about the beta.
 [11:25:44 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The problem was fixed long before I became a member of the development staff.
 [11:25:49 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh
 [11:25:56 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So you wouldn't know what caused it.
 [11:26:04 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So anyway
 [11:26:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I wouldn't care what caused it.
 [11:26:25 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How about you create a timer that will destroy clan invite windows in a 30 seconds time.
 [11:26:34 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Does that sound good?
 [11:26:35 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's a possibility.
 [11:26:41 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It can be a mess.
 [11:26:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Post your suggestion in the suggestion forum and I'll consider it.
 [11:26:58 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I've loaded up like 8 bots when I was helping someone create a clan, and somehow didn't notice the windows.
 [11:27:09 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm still banned.

 [12:24:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> a whole lot less idling
 [12:24:53 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> for serious?

 [06:57:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it's true
 [06:57:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> because nothing has been sent
 [06:57:38 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> i was gonna say, ribose
 [06:57:43 PM] <Ribose-5> lol thats noob =/. but if you send something and catch a socket error, disconnect
 [06:57:46 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> gj, 0x50 required commenting out a line in the sanity, lol
 [06:57:51 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats the thing

 [06:57:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> my prog is the server
 [06:58:00 PM] <Ribose-5> but i got 0x51, which was easy
 [06:58:08 PM] <Ribose-5> now the next part is prolly harder

 [09:50:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> gah.
 [09:50:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't think that that's fixable.
 [09:51:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> just ...
 [09:51:30 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make sure that the first trigger is correct
 [09:51:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if it is, the contiue with the rest.

 [09:51:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but "..........." isn't the correct trigger
 [09:52:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no, but "..." is, and there's no way to tell the difference.
 [09:52:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> len?
 [09:52:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Len to what delimiter?
 [09:52:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> lets say you type "......say"
 [09:53:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> "..." is the trigger and "...say" is the command
 [09:53:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Correct.
 [09:53:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> "...say" isnt a command, it shouldn't excute
 [09:53:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> execute*
 [09:53:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It won't, but the next command in the list will.

 [09:53:51 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make sure the first is a command too?
 [09:53:58 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that would fix it but probably annoy people
