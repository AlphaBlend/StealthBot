 [3:33:19 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> what causes that?
 [3:33:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's a ton of different things you can do with this.

 [3:33:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Well, crashing sb for one.
 [3:33:39 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> oh

 [3:33:44 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> how's that work?
 [3:33:45 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth>  /w me
 [3:33:47 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> don't tell me "hi" crashed my bot ...
 [3:33:50 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth :: It is believed dinosaurs are extinct due to a giant meteor. That's true if you want to call Chuck Norris a giant meteor. :: GNOME POWER!!>
 [3:33:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> why does "designate  heir" crash it?
 [3:34:00 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> rofl
 [3:34:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> screwing with the banlist, designating new users, and if someone has a backup channel on kick, you can make them always join it when they join the channel.
 [3:34:07 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth> Hi
 [3:34:10 PM] <Alendar> Pyro, is port 21 forwarded at all?
 [3:34:18 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [3:34:19 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> alendar, no, hold on
 [3:34:24 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> let me try
 [3:34:26 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> david
 [3:34:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The message SB looks for is very specific.
 [3:34:31 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> give me enough access to change the motd
 [3:34:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I set the motd here to a malformed designated heir message.
 [3:34:50 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> how would i make them join the backup channel on kick?
 [3:34:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> it reads the ServerInfo though
 [3:34:56 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> david
 [3:35:01 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> 1337setmotd blah blah kick
 [3:35:04 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> your name was kicked by bob?
 [3:35:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> SB assumes it's the real message, parses it as such, and fails to do so.
 [3:35:09 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> or
 [3:35:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes.
 [3:35:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> LOL
 [3:35:22 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> blah blah kicked
 [3:35:24 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> that's it
 [3:35:28 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> try it
 [3:35:35 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> eric, let me ask you something
 [3:35:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [3:35:45 PM] <Alendar> David?
 [3:36:02 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> it splits the message, then takes the third element, to determin ban evasion if the word was "banned"?
 [3:36:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> something like that, why?
 [3:36:30 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Username blah banned = add "username" to ban evasion?
 [3:36:36 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> Alendar, forwarded.
 [3:36:47 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> lol that's hilarious
 [3:36:55 PM] <Alendar> Thank you.
 [3:36:55 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> how would it crash the bot though?
 [3:37:01 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> David, you're a genius.
 [3:37:04 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> and phix*
 [3:37:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> faulty string handling.
 [3:37:11 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> yup
 [3:37:14 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> but
 [3:37:28 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> say you set 0x032 as the third phrase in the motd.
 [3:37:37 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> chr(032)
 [3:37:41 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> will it crasah the bot?
 [3:37:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.l
 [3:37:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> What will?
 [3:38:01 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> I'm just curious as to how
 [3:38:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I guess I'm just going to have to implement a time-based check.
 [3:38:46 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Ok. Tell me more.
 [3:38:49 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> why not just take the motd out of the serverinfo event?
 [3:39:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The motd is a server info event.
 [3:39:09 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> *sigh*
 [3:39:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i know, take it out and put it in its own event, lol
 [3:39:18 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> the mtod packet calls the ServerInfo event though.
 [3:39:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The motd packet is a severinfo event.
 [3:39:46 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Can it be separated into it's own event?
 [3:39:50 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you cant change which event it calls?
 [3:39:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [3:39:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> ...
 [3:39:56 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> wow.
 [3:40:02 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> That's retarded.
 [3:40:07 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you can in rcb..
 [3:40:09 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [3:40:11 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> So SB doesn't even call that event with the packet?
 [3:40:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't believe so.
 [3:40:24 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> it just says "I'm a ServerInfo event"?
 [3:40:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, Battle.net sends it automatically when you join the channel.
 [3:40:39 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> oO
 [3:40:42 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> stealth is on.
 [3:40:55 PM] -- Joined channel: Clan SBs --
 [3:40:55 PM] -- Eric[nK]@Azeroth has acquired ops.
 [3:40:55 PM] omg hai
 [3:41:06 PM] -- Joined channel: Clan BoT --
 [3:41:10 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> eric
 [3:41:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [3:41:24 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> on rcb, the code for the clanmotd packet being received
 [3:41:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> calls its own event
 [3:41:33 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> [3:45:25 PM] <To slyck> want to come to clan bot?
 [3:41:33 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth>  [3:45:31 PM] <To slyck> when you're done?
 [3:41:35 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth>  [3:45:36 PM] <PyroManiac606> on rcb, the code for the clanmotd packet being received
 [3:41:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> RaiseEvent ClanMOTD(Packet.GetNTString)
 [3:41:39 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth>  [3:45:38 PM] <From slyck> sure.
 [3:41:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, there's two separate instances when you receive the motd.
 [3:41:48 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> oh
 [3:41:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> One is when you request it, the other when Battle.net sends it without request.
 [3:41:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm.
 [3:42:09 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> *Sigh*
 [3:42:20 PM] <Alendar> I am having trouble connecting to the FTP server on the localhost.
 [3:42:21 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> when you request it that's for checking the motd. IS there a command in SB to do that?
 [3:42:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [3:42:38 PM] <Alendar> I do have access to the localhost right?
 [3:42:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm.
 [3:42:42 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> can you reject the motd packet?
 [3:42:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You gave me an idea vector.
 [3:42:45 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> yes alendar
 [3:42:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> What idea?
 [3:43:10 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Hmm.
 [3:43:24 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> stealth is coming in here when he finishes his dota game.
 [3:43:36 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> He told me, anyway.
 [3:44:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I can request the clan's motd from Battle.net and then simply filter it out when I join the channel.
 [3:44:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hehe.
 [3:44:14 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> o.O
 [3:44:17 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> nice
 [3:44:22 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> but you have to accept it?
 [3:44:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> huh?
 [3:44:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i just owned JD
 [3:44:42 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Why not...
 [3:44:44 PM] -- slyck@Azeroth [63ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan JV)
 [3:44:47 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> put the motd into a variable.
 [3:44:53 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> or...
 [3:44:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> wait.
 [3:44:56 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> that'd be pointless
 [3:44:57 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> o.o
 [3:44:59 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hi stealth
 [3:45:03 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> hi. what's up?
 [3:45:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You're restating what I've already said.  ;p
 [3:45:08 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Yeah, filter out "banned" and "kicked"
 [3:45:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no no no.
 [3:45:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> discovering really cool bugs!
 [3:45:31 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> yes.
 [3:45:36 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> oh?
 [3:45:40 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ;P
 [3:45:42 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> What do you intend to do, eric?
 [3:45:45 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Stealth <3
 [3:45:53 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> stealth, can I be a mod for TS?
 [3:45:59 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ..
 [3:46:07 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [3:46:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> http://ersan.us/src/bnetdocs/contenteeb4.html?Section=m&Code=381
 [3:46:44 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Hi Stealth. o.0
 [3:46:54 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Oh
 [3:46:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Grab motd before joining channel.  Create timer when joining channel.  Filter any server info message that contains the motd for duration of timer.
 [3:47:03 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> so 0x7C is called when a user joins the channel.
 [3:47:03 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> hey. :p
 [3:47:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [3:47:15 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> what's the bug in question?
 [3:47:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a separate message.
 [3:47:26 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> the motd being treated as a serverinfo message
 [3:47:31 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> 0x7C is requested near the end of the login sequence
 [3:47:38 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> that's because its handler raises the serverinfo event
 [3:47:48 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ya
 [3:47:50 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> pretty blue text and all
 [3:47:50 PM] <NNG-Vector@Azeroth> Hmm.
 [3:47:53 PM] <slyck@Azeroth> it doesn't have a separate event
