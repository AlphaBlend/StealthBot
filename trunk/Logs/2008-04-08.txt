 [01:33:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>  [15:31:45.384] <IdleBoT> you should make the delay not-so-random and use what position they're in the channel list

 [01:34:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=32155 ribose would never make a post like that
 [01:34:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's a good idea, Jack, but the problem is that not everyone uses the same database, or even the same bot, so basing it off anything non-random really won't work very effectively in every situation.
 [01:34:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why does database matter?
 [01:35:09 PM] <PhiX> JACK IS SO RIGHT
 [01:35:15 PM] <PhiX> he deserves special thanks
 [01:35:35 PM] <PhiX> @;;whereis bot-vector
 [01:35:36 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if you are already putting a delay, why not just make the delay a fixed one
 [01:35:37 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> The user "bot-vector" is not logged on.
 [01:35:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Well, what specifically are you referring to?  Giving each moderator a designated interval to allow based on channel position?
 [01:36:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yea
 [01:36:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if someone did "ops, cb sex"
 [01:36:11 PM] <PhiX> hm
 [01:36:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Actually...
 [01:36:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [01:36:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you're bot would start at .2, idlebot would start at .5
 [01:36:20 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> or whatever
 [01:36:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and it continues like that
 [01:36:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That isn't a bad idea.
 [01:36:39 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> YA IM FULL OF THEM
 [01:36:44 PM] <PhiX>  [22:38:12.435] <PhiX> JACK IS SO RIGHT
 [01:36:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because if you use random
 [01:37:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> everybot might random 1 second (or whatever.)
 [01:37:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, I know -- you can easily get two users banning at the same time.

 [05:33:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> fuck it
 [05:33:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ill do it later with sql
 [05:33:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> lolol
 [05:33:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> scrabble!
 [05:34:00 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> im not sure
 [05:34:03 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> how im gonna do scrabble
 [05:34:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> a league script is probably better in sql
 [05:34:21 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> in scrabble
 [05:34:24 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> theres a certain # of a's
 [05:34:26 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> and z's
 [05:34:39 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and i's
 [05:34:43 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> ja
 [05:34:50 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not w's though
 [05:35:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what i would probably do is
 [05:35:28 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> i mean
 [05:35:31 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> hard code
 [05:35:34 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> or dynamic
 [05:35:35 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> ?
 [05:35:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make a dictionary with "AAAA" (4 A's, but isn't there 6-8 in scrabble?) and then make another part of the array/class to have points
 [05:36:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> dic.add "A", Array("AAAAAA", 1)
 [05:36:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then
 [05:36:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> when you start a game
 [05:36:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you create a "bag" or something
 [05:36:28 PM] -- Death[swh] [297ms] has joined the channel using Diablo II Lord of Destruction (Champion Malevolence, a level 96 necromancer on realm USEast).
 [05:36:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and a "pool"
 [05:36:38 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and a dictionary or something for each player
 [05:36:49 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its the letters
 [05:36:51 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> that matter
 [05:36:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> everytime you remove from bag, just remove one of the letters 
 [05:36:54 PM] <Death[swh]> its the virus
 [05:36:57 PM] <Death[swh]> that matter
 [05:37:13 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> how are you gonna randomize that jack
 [05:37:14 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> lol
 [05:37:16 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> count them each time?
 [05:37:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so if you take an "A" out of the bag (which is basically the dictionary with "AAAA")
 [05:37:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you would make the new A key AAA
 [05:37:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> randomize
 [05:37:34 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> would bel ike
 [05:37:46 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> (rnd*26)+1
 [05:37:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then
 [05:37:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> check if theres a letter avaiable
 [05:38:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and if there is, take it out
 [05:38:08 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> it will slow down as the letters go away
 [05:38:13 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> since its really random
 [05:38:15 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> each time
 [05:38:21 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> the last letter will take a good second or 2
 [05:38:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i doubt you'll notice

 [05:38:29 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> >.<
 [05:38:37 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> i suppose
 [05:38:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ill 
 [05:38:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> see the
 [05:38:48 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> thats still a 1/26 odd
 [05:38:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> in a .vbs
 [05:38:50 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> for each letter
 [05:39:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> well, when does the game end?
 [05:39:08 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> when there are no letters
 [05:39:12 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> but see this
 [05:39:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> hmm i guess
 [05:39:17 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> if there are 8 a's
 [05:39:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you could do like
 [05:39:19 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> and 1 z
 [05:39:22 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> it's still
 [05:39:23 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> 1/2 for a
 [05:39:25 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> instead of 8/9
 [05:39:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> string curLetters = join all the dictionarys some how
 [05:39:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then 
 [05:39:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> mid(curLetters, rnd*len(), 1)
 [05:39:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that should be fast
 [05:39:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and accurate
 [05:39:49 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> then remove it

 [05:39:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yes
