 [01:48:44 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> do you have a function that returns a boolean if someone is on the userlist or not?

 [01:49:08 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> GetDBEntry().
 [01:49:47 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> That takes two lines. I'd like one line. I know you can use colons, but I think there should be an easier way too
 [01:49:59 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Because you're really seeing if username equals -1
 [01:50:14 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'd like something sort of like IsSafelisted(), but like HasAccess()
 [01:50:48 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I believe beginning with dev release five, GetDBEntry returns an object; If(GetDBEntry(user).username <> vbnullstring) Then
 [01:50:56 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Single line.
