 [9:52:01 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> why do you need proxies?
 [9:52:23 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> im ip banned?
 [9:52:25 AM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth :: The Great Wall of China was originally created to keep Chuck Norris out. It failed miserably. :: GNOME POWER!!>
 [9:52:30 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> still?
 [9:52:43 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yes..
 [9:52:47 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> your tech acc isn't back yet
 [9:52:54 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> one of my bots didnt stop trying to reconnect
 [9:52:58 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> all night. >_>
 [9:53:03 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> that's noob
 [9:53:14 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yea
 [9:53:25 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> pressing disconnect doesnt stop it from trying to connect
 [9:53:26 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> StealthBot needs an intelligent built-in reconnect feature
 [9:53:35 AM] -- Pyro[BoT]@Azeroth [1516ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)

 [9:53:40 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What's wrong with the current system?
 [9:53:47 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> it's noov
 [9:53:49 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> noob*
 [9:53:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How so?
 [9:53:56 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> and it's set to 2 minutes
 [9:53:58 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> instead of 20
 [9:54:01 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> when you are IP banned
 [9:54:14 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ew@20minutes.
 [9:54:18 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and pressing disconnect..
 [9:54:30 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> doesnt stop it from trying to reconnect
 [9:54:48 AM] <From Pyro6-Tech@Azeroth> Your friend Pyro6-Tech has entered Battle.net.
 [9:54:50 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> but if you have several bots and each one is trying to connect every 2 minutes in different time intervals you are fucked >.<
 [9:54:58 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think that the disconnect button issue has been fixed.
 [9:55:07 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I had to screw around with all of SB's timers.
 [9:55:34 AM] -- Pyro[Gnome]@Azeroth [1953ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon)
 [9:55:50 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> but it would be neat to have a built-in reconnect if your connection was interrupted
 [9:56:00 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It does already.
 [9:56:06 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> really?
 [9:56:12 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's supposed to..
 [9:56:16 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> hm
 [9:56:20 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> not if you're on a beta, though.
 [9:56:22 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> maybe, I always had the arc installed
 [9:56:29 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm
 [9:56:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> beta: connection failure -> reconnect attempt -> auth fails -> reconnect attempts disabled.
 [9:56:46 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [9:56:56 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> well
 [9:57:11 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> and with intelligent I mean if the bot is IP banned it increases the time between each reconnect attempt
 [9:57:13 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> if it tries to reconnect and gets the ip ban message 3 times, it should stop
 [9:57:25 AM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth :: Chuck Norris' sperm can be seen with the naked eye. Each one is the size of a quarter. :: GNOME POWER!!>
 [9:57:26 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The ipban message is incorrect.
 [9:57:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I should fix that.
 [9:57:30 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> one of my bots tried connecting every two minutes while it was banned
 [9:57:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's only an ipban if you connect first.
 [9:57:55 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so now im ip banned for like... 10 minutes
