 [03:03:44 PM] <PhiX@USEast> how can I set a command to 0 access?
 [03:04:13 PM] <Eric[nK]> <access />
 [03:04:25 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> that makes it accessible to the console only
 [03:04:28 PM] <Eric[nK]> Or, you mean, so that anyone can use it?
 [03:04:32 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> yeah
 [03:04:39 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can't.
 [03:04:39 PM] <PhiX[BoT]>     <access>
 [03:04:41 PM] <PhiX[BoT]>       <rank>0</rank>
 [03:04:42 PM] <PhiX[BoT]>     </access>
 [03:04:44 PM] <Eric[nK]> Set it to 1, and add * 1.
 [03:04:45 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> doesn't work either
 [03:04:55 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> that's ... dumb ;[
 [03:05:04 PM] <Eric[nK]> So is adding a command with zero access.
 [03:05:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> That doesn't make sense.
 [03:05:11 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> no
 [03:05:20 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> see how many people are doing it
 [03:05:31 PM] <Eric[nK]> If you have zero access, you have no access to commands.
 [03:05:50 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> except for the commands you don't need access for >_>
 [03:06:01 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> then why does !inbox work? :o!
 [03:06:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> Because inbox works on the precondition that you have mail.
 [03:06:29 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> it's still a command you are using
 [03:06:48 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's not a command in the traditional sense.
 [03:06:52 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> thats hardcoded into the bot though.
 [03:07:06 PM] <Eric> all of the commands are
 [03:07:08 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> shush luci
 [03:07:11 PM] <Eric> lol
 [03:07:31 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> well, my point was that its hard coded to not require any access, just the fact if you have mail.
 [03:07:57 PM] <Eric[nK]> If you set a command to zero access, you open yourself up to potential abuse.
 [03:08:07 PM] <VBScript> pingme can srsly be abused
 [03:08:08 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> if peopel decide to do so ...
 [03:08:09 PM] <VBScript> ;(
 [03:08:09 PM] <Eric[nK]> At least if you set * to 1, you can easily disable all access.
 [03:08:23 PM] <Eric> i agree with eric on that point
 [03:08:25 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can also set individual users to 'I' and have their access muted.
 [03:08:25 PM] <Eric> ;o
 [03:08:36 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> I can already hear all the newbs asking for it

 [08:15:28 PM] <Pyro6> because i miss a lot of school during the year
 [08:15:37 PM] <Pyro6> i have to take some classes over the summer
 [08:16:08 PM] <Pyro6> its not punishment... just lets me do funner stuff during the year
 [08:16:45 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> basically.. in classes you didnt get your full credits?
 [08:16:47 PM] <DeAtHZeRg> I like that idea lucifr
 [08:16:50 PM] <Alendar> While I won't be here during the day in June so it's not like you're missing much.
 [08:16:54 PM] <DeAtHZeRg> i might get on it
 [08:17:07 PM] <Pyro6> no i just dont have the classes
 [08:17:10 PM] <DeAtHZeRg> tho they won't have any real function and they will all be broken but hey they will be random
 [08:17:15 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> i see
 [08:17:19 PM] <Pyro6> i had 2 free periods this year, because i was needed for other stuff
 [08:17:46 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> well you could get more advanced, and have it fix any bugs as well :)
 [08:18:19 PM] <Pyro6> an even better idea would be to have the plugin post them on sbnet
 [08:18:25 PM] <Pyro6> and have other people fix them for you
 [08:18:30 PM] <Pyro6> oo
 [08:18:39 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> lol.
