 [11:09:55 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> err i like to make my own designs*
 [11:10:30 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> Do you know of any workaround for warden besides the ol' proxy routing method which is sloppy, or the method that requires an actualy client to be connected?
 [11:10:48 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> lol...
 [11:10:49 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> Jd, lol.
 [11:10:57 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> the first method isn't possible however.
 [11:10:59 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> ??
 [11:11:04 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> the routing method.
 [11:11:06 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> WHAT JOEL!

 [11:11:43 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> Run the real game, connect it to a proxy server, run stealthbot to the proxy, then somehow forward starcraft's warden response through the proxy and act as if stealthbot sent it.
 [11:11:58 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> Jd, I said lol to....
 [11:12:03 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth>  [11:12:14 PM] <Jd[BoT]> err i like to make my own designs*

 [11:21:20 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> Have you seen the developers at bwhacks.com?
 [11:21:50 PM] <Adventism@Azeroth> And how they've learned to "hook" processes (I'm not sure how it works), so that their hacks can bypass Battle.Net's anti-hacking mechanisms?
