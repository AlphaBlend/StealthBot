 [08:24:25 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i dont have the rte codes memorized like vector does
 [08:24:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> RTE 6?
 [08:24:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Overflow.
 [08:24:55 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=31185
 [08:25:07 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm
 [08:25:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I hate RTEs.
 [08:25:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I wish we could find a pattern to these.
 [08:25:43 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i havent gotten that rte since like... 2.6995 or 7
 [08:26:06 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i've been only getting it on this bot
 [08:26:36 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> started with devolopment release 2 i think... for meh anyways
 [08:26:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't doubt that it's an issue; the only question is what that issue is and why it's only affecting a limited number of users.
 [08:26:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> luc1fr
 [08:26:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> delete your users.txt?
 [08:27:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't think that's it.
 [08:27:14 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> jack, i've tried that
 [08:27:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I thought it was (seen that error in relation to that before), but I don't think that it's it.
 [08:27:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> LuC1Fr: How often does this occur?
 [08:27:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> try installing 2.6 in a different folder and running a beta in that folder
 [08:27:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> with completely new files
 [08:27:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Do you have logging enabled?
 [08:28:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> how big is your backlog?
 [08:28:39 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> sec
 [08:28:51 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> 20000
 [08:29:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> try setting it to 10000 (default) for a few days?
 [08:29:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> idk i kind of doubt that would cause it!

 [08:36:54 PM] <IdleBoT> thats kind of annoying

 [08:37:18 PM] <IdleBoT> you disabled it?

 [08:37:45 PM] <Eric[nK]> :|
 [08:37:52 PM] <IdleBoT> is the name for trigger
 [08:37:57 PM] <IdleBoT> "trigger" Or "?trigger"
 [08:38:07 PM] <Eric[nK]> The command name is trigger.
 [08:38:22 PM] <Eric[nK]> '?' is just a universal trigger for specifically that command.
 [08:38:23 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> adding -debug to the target line only shows packets..right? nothing with the bot
 [08:38:25 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> ?

 [08:39:07 PM] <IdleBoT> didnt work
 [08:39:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> oh, the problem is with IsCommand().
 [08:39:21 PM] <Eric[nK]> like I've said, it's already fixed.
 [08:39:22 PM] <IdleBoT> oh
 [08:39:26 PM] <IdleBoT> because i tried /trigger
 [08:39:30 PM] <IdleBoT> and i was like "hmm" =/

 [10:27:59 PM] <Eric[nK]> It is now; Jack alerted me of the issue.
 [10:28:17 PM] <Joe[BoT]> What's the block that needs to be added?
 [10:28:22 PM] <IdleBoT> just

 [10:29:09 PM] <Joe[BoT]> Wouldn't that cause everyone to have access?
 [10:29:30 PM] <Eric[nK]> Right now, yes, everyone will have access... sadly.
 [10:29:41 PM] <Eric[nK]> However, it's *supposed* to make just console access.
 [10:29:50 PM] <Eric[nK]> It does in dev four.
 [10:30:26 PM] <Joe[BoT]> wont <access><rank>20</rank></access> work?
 [10:30:53 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes.
 [10:31:11 PM] <Eric[nK]> Where did you activity come from all of a sudden, anyway, Joe?
 [10:31:25 PM] <IdleBoT> he got afraid of school.
 [10:31:31 PM] <Joe[BoT]> The fact that the beta program gets updated more than once every two years.
 [10:31:33 PM] <Eric[nK]> ah.
 [10:31:39 PM] <Joe[BoT]> And that Jack makes me lul with his sillyness.
 [10:31:52 PM] <IdleBoT> its ok that you're afraid of school

 [11:10:11 PM] <Bot-Vector> It should be a constant.
 [11:10:22 PM] <Bot-Vector> IF you can somehow "lock" it, as you can't do the same for constants.
 [11:10:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> I'm aware.
 [11:10:42 PM] <Bot-Vector> Can you lock a variant?
 [11:10:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> I've been trying to think of a way to lock all of the BotVars for sometime now.
 [11:10:55 PM] <Bot-Vector> Hm.
 [11:11:15 PM] <Bot-Vector> Just reject the call if "BotVars" and "=" are in the same expression, or is that a bad idea?
 [11:11:34 PM] <Eric[nK]> Seeing as how you can't bypass auth anymore, it wouldn't be a conflict of interest for you to think of something, either.

 [11:13:42 PM] <Ferre7> is it possible to use a timer, in the exec script?
 [11:13:58 PM] <DarkMage2303> Isn't exec built in?
