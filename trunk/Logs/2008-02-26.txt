 [04:14:41 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> .: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Development Release 1 by Stealth.

 [04:14:52 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> and 3 non

 [04:14:58 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> only 1 development
 [04:15:25 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth :: [16:45:11] <PrivT-Tech> i got a hacker on my comp o.o and were seeing whos better   [16:46:52] -- PrivT-Tech has left the channel. [16:47:45] <Tech-PhiX> i guess the hacker won :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 :.>
 [04:15:36 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric did you mess up more code to make the bots slower?
 [04:15:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yeah
 [04:15:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> they do feel slower
 [04:16:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> especially sending messages
 [04:16:15 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [04:16:23 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you get used to it..
 [04:16:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> The first ban is delayed by a random value between 100 - 700 ms.
 [04:16:40 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but i guess it would be a disadvantage if you were say... doing speed challenge or trivia
 [04:16:51 PM] <Eric[nK]> The first message, no matter what it is, is sent with a delay of 100ms.
 [04:17:09 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> .
 [04:17:10 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> .
 [04:17:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> .
 [04:17:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that was not delayed at all
 [04:17:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> unless only the message sent to bnet is delayed
 [04:18:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and addchat appears right away*
 [04:18:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> .
 [04:18:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> .
 [04:18:14 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> .
 [04:18:22 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> why is it sent with a delay
 [04:18:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's delayed, but 1/100th of a second is quite a small delay.
 [04:18:31 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the messages
 [04:18:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its noticable though
 [04:18:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> stop flooding?
 [04:19:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> The bans are delayed to prevent duplicate banning.
 [04:19:16 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yet that didn't work
 [04:19:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because every bot still banned each person..

 [08:38:56 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, lets chat in clan mage.
 [08:39:04 PM] -- Joined channel: Clan MAGE --
 [08:39:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So eric.
 [08:39:27 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> With the current version, what new features did you allow scripters to use, or is it still the same?
 [08:39:38 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> The current beta version, I should add.
 [08:39:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The beta was fully detailed in the beta development forum.
 [08:40:10 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Then I am hindered from being banned.
 [08:40:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm sorry.
 [08:40:26 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, can you tell Stealth to talk to me?
 [08:40:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [08:40:31 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He was on earlier playing a game.
 [08:40:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> cool.
 [08:40:58 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm really interested on getting unbanned.
 [08:41:24 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He plays dota in his free time, as I'm sure you already knew.
 [08:41:39 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> Eric, you play Warcraft?
 [08:41:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [08:42:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Current MP3 [1/1]: Tool - Pushit (00:00/09:55)

 [08:42:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [08:42:52 PM] Current MP3 [1/1]: Tool - Pushit (00:00/09:55)
 [08:42:59 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, do you care if people attain the beta through third-party methods?
 [08:43:14 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> If they aren't beta testers?
 [08:43:32 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> I was told by eric (or berserker, can't remember exactly), that "Stealth doesn't give a fuck about people bypassing beta."
 [08:43:42 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> i think that was bers though..
 [08:44:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The next development release will not be bypassable via the scripting method.
 [08:44:27 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How is that?
 [08:44:28 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> how so?
 [08:44:36 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> There are always ways around that.
 [08:44:47 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> I already thought of 2..
 [08:44:50 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You would have to disable the Command function.
 [08:45:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Which isn't practical.
 [08:45:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This method takes care of that as well.
 [08:45:17 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> What is this method eric/
 [08:45:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... without having to disable the command function.
 [08:45:19 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How exactly are you going to restrict it?
 [08:45:19 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> ?
 [08:45:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm not at liberty to discuss the issue with non-beta testers.
 [08:45:40 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> k
 [08:45:46 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> I'm a beta tester
 [08:45:51 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [08:46:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Ferre, botvars.username and the command version?
 [08:46:13 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> heh?
 [08:46:14 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> as in /setname <bleh>
 [08:46:31 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, Are you disabling the ability to change botvars.username?
 [08:46:34 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> i know a way that they can make it so its not bypassable
 [08:46:40 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> but they'd have to add like.. 5 things
 [08:46:41 PM] <vbNullString@Azeroth <ifndef-tech> there is no sleep in vbs .: StealthBot v2.6 Revision 3>
 [08:46:46 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How is that?
 [08:47:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No, Vector.  I'm not disabling anything, except the ability to script your way around the authorization.
 [08:48:04 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It is always possible.
 [08:48:10 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> always*
 [08:48:17 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yes.
 [08:48:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Of course, but no longer with scripting.
 [08:48:27 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> But still other ways
 [08:48:30 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I know.
 [08:48:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [08:48:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Of course, but no longer with scripting.
 [08:48:37 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, yes or no.
 [08:48:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> brb, recompile.

 [08:49:38 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> smart fellow
 [08:49:53 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> well they should make sure that that person has control of all 8, before authorizing all 8
 [08:49:53 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> four warcraft realms, and four non warcraft realms.
 [08:50:12 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I don't think that's possible.
 [08:50:20 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> umm
 [08:50:26 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> i have all 8 of Ferre7
 [08:50:28 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric would have no way of checking if the account actually belonged to the user.
 [08:50:36 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> ask them
 [08:50:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... why would I ever do something that silly?
 [08:50:46 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> umm
 [08:50:50 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> That was ferre, not me.
 [08:50:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'd just make authorizations gateway-specific.
 [08:50:58 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [08:51:00 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> thats what i just said..
 [08:51:02 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> basically*
 [08:51:05 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He was joking?
 [08:51:12 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I assume eric was playing around with you.
 [08:51:18 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> i assume he wouldn't
 [08:51:20 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> wasn't*
 [08:51:23 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> since hes most likely a robot
 [08:51:27 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> lol
 [08:51:28 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> according to my statistics
 [08:51:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You said it in a contorted way.
 [08:51:44 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [08:49:53 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> well they should make sure that that person has control of all 8, before authorizing all 8
 [08:51:45 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, you'd then disable the /setname command through the Command function?
 [08:52:06 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> And I said it's impossible to check.
 [08:52:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no, nothing was disabled.
 [08:52:20 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> .............
 [08:52:26 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Ok.
 [08:52:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ./setname still works, Command() still works, CommandEx() still works, etc.
 [08:52:52 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> CommandEx()?
 [08:53:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, CommandEx().
 [08:53:14 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> how would you use that?
 [08:53:25 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> CommandEx("/setname username")
 [08:53:26 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> ?
 [08:53:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The same way that you would use Command(), except CommandEx() returns an array containing the message that it would have normally just sent to Battle.net.

 [09:12:52 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> Don't incorrectly assume that because I'm leaving Battle.net, I'm being disconnected.

 [09:13:49 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> no.
 [09:13:58 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> o.o

 [09:14:30 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> Why do you feel that you deserve an unban?
 [09:14:58 PM] <From Mage_@Azeroth> All I did, was let vector vnc onto my computer and post in a few Tech Support topics
 [09:15:13 PM] <From Mage_@Azeroth> since he wanted to, and he was going to help me with something.
 [09:15:44 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> I didn't ask why you were banned -- I already knew the answer to that.
 [09:15:57 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth :: [02:26:58.250] <Eric[nK]> I changed the queue, slighly, but it shouldn't have affected the queue. :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 :.>
 [09:16:51 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, his ban was caused by a third-party individual who posted support on his account.
 [09:17:01 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> If he gets unbanned, I promise it will never happen again.
 [09:17:08 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm talking in reference to Mage_
 [09:18:30 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I don't recall asking you anything, Vector.
 [09:19:30 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He had posted the message in this channel
 [09:19:32 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I felt it was my duty to tell you exactly how it happened.
 [09:19:47 PM] <From Mage_@Azeroth> I didn't actually break any rules, there is nothing against letting him post in tech support which probably helped the people whos topic he posted in.
 [09:19:54 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It would be unfair to have him banned when he did not account for any wrong doing.
 [09:19:55 PM] <From Mage_@Azeroth> - on my computer.
 [09:20:11 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It wasn't your duty to do anything -- in fact, your involvement in the issue is only to the detriment of mage.
 [09:20:32 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> He cannot be at fault for my actions.
 [09:20:43 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> His actions are his own.
 [09:20:52 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I did it on his account though.
 [09:21:00 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> And he let you.
 [09:21:45 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ... He let me VNC him. I wanted to post support on his account.
 [09:22:13 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm for certain if you asked him, he would tell you he had no idea of the impending consequences.
 [09:22:36 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> While the rule may not be explicitly stated, it would be reasonable to assume that allowing a member that you knew to be banned on the forum to bypass the ban by using your account would be against the [more]
 [09:22:42 PM] <To Mage_@Azeroth> rules, would it not?
 [09:23:20 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So, his actions were not his ultimate downfall.
 [09:23:52 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> However, allowing me on his account, he did not see the coming problem of me actually using his account, to get past a ban.
 [09:24:28 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You may not have been a good friend in this situation here, Vector, and mage had to pay the price for befriending you.  However, mage's choice here was to allow you to procede with your actions on [more]
 [09:24:28 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> And, actually the reason for the ban was not me at all. It was because the IP used on that account was tracked to an IP in canada, which was not true. It was an IP in New Zealand.
 [09:24:33 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> his account.
 [09:25:30 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> This is not your fault, but you did help and you have already faced the most severe punishment we are capable of giving you.  You have no relevant involvement in this issue and if you continue this [more]
 [09:25:36 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> argument, my only response to you
 [09:25:39 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> will come in the form of a squelch.
 [09:26:33 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> well, to that end, this ends now.

 [09:51:41 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> or did they fix that
 [09:51:45 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> No one is using the beta currently.
 [09:51:50 PM] <Ferre7@Azeroth> hmm?
 [09:51:54 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> wouldn't eric be on the beta

 [09:52:27 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> I thought if they were just in the channel they got a RTE
 [09:52:35 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> that sounds quite accurate.

 [09:54:29 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> .... Mmm
 [09:54:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm just wondering how I'm going to go about parsing.
 [09:54:56 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It's fairly easy, I'm just figuring the approach.
