 [08:35:23 AM] <PhiX> Hi Eric
 [08:35:53 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hi, dr. phix.
 [08:36:07 AM] <PhiX> dr.?
 [08:36:26 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, it's an abbreviation for doctor.
 [08:36:35 AM] <PhiX> I know, but ... did I miss something? o.0
 [08:37:38 AM] <PhiX> I'm not a scientologist!

 [08:38:10 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hax.
 [08:38:41 AM] <PhiX> brain hax ...
 [08:40:35 AM] <PhiX> pyro died ...
 [08:40:37 AM] <PhiX> and I need his bot
 [08:40:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> poor pyro.
 [08:40:52 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> poor phix.
 [08:40:57 AM] <PhiX> ya ;[
 [08:41:08 AM] <PhiX> "0x5E@azeroth" was last seen leaving this channel 1 hours and 10 minutes ago.
 [08:41:21 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> poor, poor phix.
 [08:41:30 AM] <PhiX> Added mail for 0x5E@Azeroth.
 [08:41:42 AM] <PhiX> hm
 [08:41:59 AM] Error: Invalid procedure call or argument in ProcessCommand().
 [08:42:14 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> @;;mail God Are you there, God?  It's me, Margret.
 [08:42:15 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Added mail for God.
 [08:42:27 AM] <PhiX> wtfux
 [08:42:43 AM] <PhiX> is that some kind of famous quote or was that random?

 [08:43:32 AM] <PhiX> I see
 [08:43:38 AM] <PhiX> never heard of it though
 [08:43:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> loser.
 [08:44:20 AM] <PhiX> we didn't read that many books in English class ...
 [08:44:50 AM] <PhiX> I can't recall any book right now
 [08:44:51 AM] <PhiX> hm
 [08:45:25 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ew @ astronomy class in 45 minutes.

 [08:45:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> bad, phix.
 [08:45:52 AM] <PhiX> I broked it!
 [08:46:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no, I'm just working on commands.xml.
 [08:46:22 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I created a new function for scripters: HasAccess().
 [08:46:43 AM] <PhiX> isn't that Swent's job?
 [08:46:48 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If (HasAccess(Username, Command.Name, Command.Args)) Then
 [08:47:11 AM] <PhiX> Then WHAT?!
 [08:47:35 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Swent's job is the plugin system, yes.  However, I'm redesigning large portions of the bot, consequently allowing me to do many things for scripters.
 [08:48:07 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> IsCommand() -> HasAccess() -> handle command.
 [08:48:29 AM] <PhiX> well
 [08:48:47 AM] <PhiX> Swent could start rewriting the server plugins
 [08:49:21 AM] <PhiX> many of them are outdated or bugged
 [08:49:42 AM] <PhiX> and I think when 2.7 is released they should be upgraded by using the new functions
 [08:50:24 AM] <PhiX> do you have FTP access for sb.net?
 [08:50:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't have access to the root section.
 [08:51:45 AM] <PhiX> shouldn't root admins have access to the root section? ;o
 [08:52:02 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Obviously not.
 [08:53:23 AM] <PhiX> pyro's AIM is logging on and off
 [08:53:59 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> He's signaling for you.
 [08:54:17 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> "Siggn meee onnn to Battlllle.net."
 [08:54:37 AM] <PhiX> lol
 [08:54:48 AM] <PhiX> brb, trying to crash the beta

 [08:55:33 AM] <PhiX> success!
 [08:55:38 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [08:55:52 AM] <PhiX> it's not a beta problem
 [08:55:58 AM] <PhiX> I can do the same for 2.6
 [08:56:02 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What?
 [08:56:15 AM] <PhiX> I'm on my notebook
 [08:56:22 AM] <PhiX> at at the right side of the touchpad
 [08:56:27 AM] <PhiX> you have a fast scroll function
 [08:56:33 AM] <PhiX> whenever I use it, SB carshes
 [08:56:41 AM] <PhiX> crashes*
 [08:56:53 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> strange.
 [08:56:55 AM] <PhiX> testing again
 [08:56:59 AM] -- PhiX has left the channel.
 [08:57:28 AM] -- PhiX [-1ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft II (0 wins).
 [08:57:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I have a scroll on my notebook as well, and it works fine.  It's those damn German scrolls...
 [08:57:37 AM] <PhiX> I don't know if it's realted to Vista
 [08:57:45 AM] <PhiX> related*
 [08:57:52 AM] <PhiX> I don't get a RTE
 [08:57:57 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I should buy Vista; Microsoft dropped the price of premium 64-bit to $110.
 [08:58:01 AM] <PhiX> it just says SB needs to be closed
 [08:58:10 AM] <PhiX> aren't you a student?
 [08:58:24 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes.
 [08:58:28 AM] <PhiX> *deactivating touchpad*
 [08:58:41 AM] <PhiX> I get special student offers sometimes
 [08:59:22 AM] <PhiX> but yeah, you should really get Vista
 [08:59:39 AM] <PhiX> if I wasn't too lazy, I would make a new account with UAC enabled and test things out
 [09:00:21 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> <3 UAC.
 [09:00:40 AM] <PhiX> yeah, it's a good feature for newbs I think, but it annoyed me
 [09:00:42 AM] <PhiX> the first day already
 [09:01:09 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a horrible feature for newbs; it's a great feature for people who understand it's purpose.
 [09:01:37 AM] <PhiX> why is it horrible for newbs?
 [09:01:57 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They don't understand it and disable it (stupidly) because it annoys them.
 [09:02:05 AM] <PhiX> lawl k
 [09:02:15 AM] <PhiX> nah, real newbs do not know how to disable it
 [09:02:22 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Do you know what it's for?
 [09:02:47 AM] <PhiX> only a bit
 [09:02:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control
 [09:03:02 AM] <PhiX> I think I read that once
 [09:03:12 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a sophisticated anti-virus system built-in to the operating system.
 [09:03:32 AM] <PhiX> the article is longer o.o
 [09:03:55 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's a feature that has had similar functionality in almost all recent previous releases.
 [09:04:23 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I have an almost identical setup on my Windows XP notebook, but UAC adds special features that capability making it much much easier.
 [09:04:47 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Again, <3 UAC.
 [09:05:33 AM] <PhiX> k, I'm a newb then, I can live without it
 [09:13:25 AM] <PhiX> 02:36, 15 February 2008 66.167.134.174 (Talk) (45 bytes) (?Replaced page with 'this is all crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!')
 [09:13:28 AM] <PhiX> lol
 [09:13:45 AM] <PhiX> the history of the UAC article
 [09:24:47 AM] <PhiX> You are already in clan  smart ass.
 [09:25:05 AM] <PhiX> oh right, VBS

 [07:03:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> is it necesarry to send keep alives to bnet anymore? it seems i get disconnected when i dont..
 [07:03:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There is already a feature for removing a user from a clan.
 [07:04:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You have to reply to SID_PING every time that it's sent, Pyro.
 [07:04:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you know if you don't add support for that, people will ask for it when 2.7 is released right?
 [07:04:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'll be able to block inheritance before 2.7 is released.
 [07:04:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> also, it's not my clan, so i can't remove whoever i want.
 [07:05:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then you shouldn't have given access to their clan.
 [07:05:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm
 [07:05:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i do ;o
 [07:05:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why eric?
 [07:05:18 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> this should be literally impossible
 [07:05:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's another crappy answer.
 [07:05:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Don't give access to people you don't want to have access, period.
 [07:05:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i didnt give this person access
 [07:06:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You gave their entire clan access, and therefore, them as well.
 [07:06:01 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> he just happened to get access because hes in the clan
 [07:06:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and i want him removed
