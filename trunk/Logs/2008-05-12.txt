 [10:55:32 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I found a 'security flaw' in PrintURLToFile

 [10:55:44 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> it works like I intended it to
 [10:55:47 AM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Did you fix it?
 [10:56:23 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's not a security flaw -- you could just as easily print to a file in the local directory and use the FSO to copy it anywhere the user has permission to access.
 [10:56:58 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> PrintURLToFile() only defaults to the program directory to encourage the storage of files directly in the directory of the bot.

 [01:08:59 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Hello Eric.
 [01:09:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Features create bugs, Jack.
 [01:09:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hi
 [01:09:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> lets remove features!
 [01:09:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> isnt the friends list causing that rte or something?
 [01:09:38 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> nix it!
 [01:10:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The friends list is functioning fine.
 [01:10:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> whats causing the rte
 [01:10:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> don't know.
 [01:10:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> lets slowly remove every feature then
 [01:10:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, if StealthBot didn't have so many features, I could likely tell you fairly quickly.
 [01:11:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> remove the user monitor
 [01:11:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Generally speaking: any large system that could easily be replicated with a script should be such.
 [01:11:25 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and stab hdx
 [01:11:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I agree.
 [01:11:49 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> btw who is getting berzerkers position?
 [01:11:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> phix
 [01:12:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The problem, however, is that the user monitor requires more complex socket operations.
 [01:12:15 PM] <PhiX> no one
 [01:12:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It should be made a component.
 [01:12:18 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but it doesnt work
 [01:12:28 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and hdx isnt going to fix it

 [09:20:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why are people so stupid :(
 [09:21:00 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> no idea
 [09:21:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you'd think, maybe they might learn something in school
 [09:21:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but no...
 [09:21:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> most people dont learn anything in school
 [09:21:44 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> they just fool around
 [09:21:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> o.0
 [09:22:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> well texas is a pretty bad schooling area im pretty sure
 [09:22:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and im either fucking smart or people around me are idiots
 [09:22:17 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> probably both
 [09:22:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> some kid today asked me what if i used windows, i said "no i dont use windows" he laughs at me and says "haha you use a mac!"
 [09:23:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then later some other kid finally says "hes using linux" (because i wouldnt tell him)
 [09:23:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and hes like "huh"
 [09:23:19 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol
 [09:23:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then hes asking
 [09:23:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> where to buy this linux for windows and how much it cost
 [09:24:09 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> wow
 [09:24:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> theres just times when you should shut up when you dont know jack shit in a computer class
 [09:24:36 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> or when some slapping should occur.
 [09:24:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you should tell them that you use Unicos
 [09:25:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i told him that i used an african operation system
 [09:25:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because ubuntu is african word for peace or something like that
 [09:25:33 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> wiki ubuntu
 [09:25:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Ubuntu may refer to:
 [09:25:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then he tried to be funny and making aids jokes
 [09:25:40 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i bed even if you mentioned that Linux is open-sourced, He may be tempted to ask if that makes it more expensive..
 [09:25:55 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i bet*
 [09:25:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> he wouldnt know what it meant
 [09:25:56 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> wow

 [09:26:05 PM] -- Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [09:26:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> he asked the kid who said linux "does that mean it's crappy because it's free?"
 [09:27:32 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah see, some slapping should have occured.
 [09:27:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i wasnt near him when he asked that
 [09:28:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> sad thing about that class, people come to me for help before they even ask the teacher 
 [09:28:46 PM] -- Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth [78ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [09:28:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> at least the teacher doesnt ask you for help
 [09:28:55 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> .
 [09:29:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> he has
 [09:29:04 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol
 [09:29:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and he rarely writes code for the class to see (he has a projector)
 [09:29:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and
 [09:29:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i've corrected him before hes compiled
 [09:29:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so many times

 [09:30:34 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> oh and our last project he tried to act like a badass when executing his code
 [09:30:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and hes like "try _that_ andrew"
 [09:31:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> of course he never checked if i did it because he was probably watching me doing it and then stuck his foot in his mouth
