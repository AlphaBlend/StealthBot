 [03:50:40 PM] <raylu> lol
 [03:50:45 PM] <raylu> sc mapping is a pain in the ass
 [03:50:52 PM] <Alendar> It is.
 [03:50:56 PM] <raylu> even for wc3 it takes forever to get anything done
 [03:51:00 PM] <Alendar> I get bored easily too
 [03:51:08 PM] <Alendar> The map design is fun.
 [03:51:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> sc is noob
 [03:51:16 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> war3 is where it's at
 [03:51:17 PM] <Alendar> The triggers get boring as hell.

 [03:51:39 PM] <Alendar> Unless I code the triggers by hand.
 [03:51:41 PM] <raylu> the triggers are easy, it just requires hardcore repetition to get anything useful done
 [03:51:48 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> sc is old school like chess wc3 is noob

 [07:33:57 PM] <Ribose-5> because it would return Username; which is the property it is, and Username = value would continuously assign it to itself
