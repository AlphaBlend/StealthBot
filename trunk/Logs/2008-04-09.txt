 [04:35:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> hmm
 [04:35:21 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i can try :D
 [04:35:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> can i use randomize?
 [04:35:37 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> as long as its fairly quick
 [04:35:42 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i also made the point system
 [04:35:47 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its a function
 [04:35:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you just do like
 [04:35:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> pts("zebra")
 [04:35:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and it returns 17

 [04:36:41 PM] <mynameisnotjack> python so great
 [04:37:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> vbs doesnt have shuffle
 [04:37:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [04:37:47 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the getletter func
 [04:37:51 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> is only like 10 lines
 [04:37:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ;D
 [04:38:27 PM] <mynameisnotjack> thats actually a lot
 [04:38:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its 8 without closing statements
 [04:39:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> could be less if i used :
 [04:41:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> k so
 [04:42:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> the scramble doesnt havee to be godly
 [04:42:17 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the bot gets a random one from that scramble too
 [04:42:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> so yeah
 [04:42:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it doesnt have to be

 [04:48:25 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> that's right ;)
 [04:48:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ninjas don't do anything illegal
 [04:48:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if they do,
 [04:48:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> they aren't caught

 [04:49:18 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> *dublins
 [04:49:35 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> i think, if i'm gonna buy a nex sword, i want a pirate sword
 [04:49:39 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> *next
 [04:49:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> idk how this scramble can't work better than it is...
 [04:50:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> pirates take dublins i thought ;o
 [04:50:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> pirates take anything that shines
 [04:51:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> idk how i fucking did it
 [04:51:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but i made like
 [04:51:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> the worst scramble e ver
 [04:51:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but if you thought about it on a piece of papper

 [04:55:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yet
 [04:55:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it looks like it doesnt loop at all
 [04:55:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> want the letters
 [04:55:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> no

 [04:57:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> str isnt set to the new string
 [04:57:36 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it starts back to the old one
 [04:57:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [04:57:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the letters
 [04:57:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> when i output them

 [05:04:43 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> yeah, nevermind
 [05:04:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> the problem is that str is staying the same
 [05:04:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then it swaps the left and right

 [05:05:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> afk
 [05:05:54 PM] <The_Black_Ninja@Azeroth> yeah, so like...don't you have to say like str = x before the next?
 [05:07:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> oh
 [05:07:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if i put a spacebetween the right and left
 [05:07:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you're swapping first and last
 [05:07:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it shows spaces in random areas
 [05:07:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> just length / 2
 [05:07:22 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and loop
 [05:07:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> huh....?
 [05:07:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> for i = 1 to length

 [05:07:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> swap l and r
 [05:07:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ...

 [05:08:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it is

 [05:08:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it cant
 [05:08:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> abcdef after 1 swap
 [05:08:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> can be
 [05:08:32 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> your trying to flip a string?

 [05:08:39 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> lol
 [05:08:41 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if we were doing that
