 [07:23:22 PM] <Alendar> Use  --display
 [07:23:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> there is no form_resize in .net?
 [07:23:39 PM] <Alendar> He shouldn't have to use that.
 [07:23:47 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> New on StealthBot Recent:  League Bot; [RESOLVED] Iso: a Chaos Script
 [07:23:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it does it for you automatically in .net?

 [07:23:58 PM] <Alendar> No.
 [07:24:00 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> is .net
 [07:24:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then how else does it do it
 [07:24:18 PM] <Alendar> David said to use the fill option.
 [07:24:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> .NET resizes forms automatically.
 [07:24:37 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [07:24:38 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> someone just said no
 [07:24:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I've used the feature several times: You just pin the object to a side.
 [07:25:03 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> im making a project in .net right now
 [07:25:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When the side grows, so does your object.
 [07:25:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> anchors?
 [07:25:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [07:26:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Nevertheless, I've added an error handling mechanism to alert the user when an attempt to op a specified user will be fruitless.
 [07:26:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what does that mean
 [07:26:16 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> fruitless?
 [07:26:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> unbeneficial?
 [07:26:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric, pyro was in a different channel
 [07:26:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and when i tried to /op his bot
 [07:27:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it took like 5 seconds (im guessing demoting)
 [07:27:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> oped him
 [07:27:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then bot froze awhile (guessing promoting)

 [07:27:51 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is fruitless
 [07:27:52 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> "fruitless" is useless; unproductive; without results or success: a fruitless search for the missing treasure.
