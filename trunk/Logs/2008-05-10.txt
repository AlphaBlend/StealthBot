 [05:42:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [05:42:09 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> What's that?
 [05:42:20 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Hi Eric.
 [05:42:23 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what would be the cause of getting an invalid cd key response from 0x51?
 [05:42:26 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Meet Eric@Azeroth.
 [05:42:37 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> afk, wow is sucking up my life again.
 [05:42:41 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> David, what's that?
 [05:42:44 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> `join clan ls
 [05:42:44 PM] -- Goliath@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [05:42:58 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its the text version of diablo
 [05:42:59 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> o.o
 [05:43:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You've either entered an invalid key (duh?) or you've reconnected too many times, setting off Battle.net's floodbot detection.
 [05:43:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but i mean like
 [05:43:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> doesnt it mean that you sent a cd key to bnet that is so messed up, the actual game couldnt be installed with it?
 [05:43:47 PM] <PhiX>  [02:38:47.956] <HoT-Odin> Hey
 [05:43:48 PM] <PhiX>  [02:38:50.091] <HoT-Odin> anyone here?
 [05:43:56 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Umm, why should I make a text version of Diablo?
 [05:43:57 PM] <PhiX> HOT
 [05:44:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It simply means, in the most general sense, that your CD-Key is invalid.
 [05:44:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> http://pyro.no-ip.biz/bnet/invalid.png =\
 [05:44:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It could have been sent in an incorrect format; decoded incorrectly; or simply failed to pass the check to ensure that the key is legit.
 [05:45:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> k it causes a two week ip ban
 [05:45:15 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and i connected to west right after i got that just fine
 [05:45:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> with that client and didnt get banned
 [05:45:44 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> so... the client fucked up and i got ip banned because of it
 [05:45:51 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> should blizzard lift the ban?
 [05:46:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> unno

 [05:57:02 PM] <PhiX> the SB font or something in the control panel?
 [05:57:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you install a faster processor (dumb++), you don't need faster ram.

 [05:59:24 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Hmm
 [05:59:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Anyway, processor upgrades are often severely limited.
 [05:59:35 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i havn't blown it out in a while, perhaps it's getting hot.
 [05:59:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They change the socket types every so often, and you are limited to the processors capatible with your motherboards socket type.
 [06:00:05 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Right.
 [06:00:09 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> I know that part.

 [06:00:10 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> :P
 [06:00:23 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> which i believe this is 775
 [06:00:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So, you'll end up spending a lot of time and money for little benefit.
 [06:02:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Oh yes: your processor speed is also limited by the fsb on your motherboard.
 [06:02:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'll have to look into your motherboard specs to see if such an upgrade is even worth looking further into.
