 [11:56:31 AM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [11:56:34 AM] <Pyro6> o.o
 [11:56:41 AM] <Eric[nK]> maybe a new beta today or tomorrow.
 [11:57:00 AM] <Alendar> yay
 [11:57:02 AM] -- Alendar has left the channel.
 [11:57:02 AM] <Pyro6> :D
 [11:57:08 AM] <Pyro6> FUCK ALENDAR DIED
 [11:57:12 AM] <Eric[nK]> just a few changes.
 [11:57:29 AM] <Pyro6> and we can get rid of the plugin system
 [11:57:33 AM] <Pyro6> ?
 [11:57:47 AM] <Eric[nK]> mhm.
 [11:57:52 AM] <Pyro6> wooooot
 [11:58:07 AM] <IdleBoT> how are timers going to work
 [11:59:02 AM] <Eric[nK]> - multiple script file loading has now been built-in internally.
 [11:59:03 AM] <Eric[nK]> - plugin menus temporarily disabled.
 [11:59:04 AM] <Eric[nK]> - CreateTimer(name, interval) and DeleteTimer(name, interval) can now be used for the purpose of controlling timers. These functions return a Timer object to allow for future reference.
 [11:59:23 AM] <Eric[nK]> oops, DeleteTimer is just DeleteTimer(name).
 [11:59:34 AM] <Pyro6> lol
 [11:59:42 AM] <IdleBoT> temporarily?
 [11:59:53 AM] <Eric[nK]> Hopefully, yes.
 [11:59:59 AM] <IdleBoT> hopefully not
 [12:00:18 PM] <Pyro6> after this release
 [12:00:25 PM] <Eric[nK]> Unfortunately, CreateTimer will create conflicts if used in a plugin, but oh well.
 [12:00:26 PM] <Pyro6> we wont need swent anymore
 [12:00:39 PM] <IdleBoT> we never did
 [12:00:41 PM] <IdleBoT> gg
 [12:00:46 PM] <Pyro6> haha
 [12:00:57 PM] <IdleBoT> i dont even know why stealth picked him to be a dev
 [12:01:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> Because of the plugin system.
 [12:01:11 PM] <IdleBoT> it's a script
 [12:01:20 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yeah, I know.
 [12:01:30 PM] <Eric[nK]> Swent was trying to make it part of the bot.
 [12:01:37 PM] <Pyro6> so you can kick swent, snap, and hdx off
 [12:01:41 PM] <Eric[nK]> That was my motivation for wanting to get rid of it.
 [12:01:44 PM] <Pyro6> and add someone else
 [12:01:52 PM] <IdleBoT> nobody else
 [12:02:02 PM] <PhiX@USEast> I vote for Hero.A
 [12:02:05 PM] <Eric[nK]> The reason why plugin menus had to be removed was because the internal setup of the bot was relying on coding in the plugin system itself.
 [12:02:07 PM] <Pyro6> i vote for vector
 [12:02:11 PM] <Eric[nK]> The two were dependent on each other.
 [12:02:19 PM] <Eric[nK]> Which is gross programatically.
 [12:02:21 PM] <IdleBoT> i dont like the plugin menus anyways
