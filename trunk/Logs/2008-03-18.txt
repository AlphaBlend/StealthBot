 [03:07:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> The UTF-8 system was backwards for debug reasons.
 [03:07:59 PM] <Eric[nK]> When you enable utf-8, you're actually disabling it.
 [03:08:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> Partially, anyway.
 [03:08:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> The decoding mechanims will still fire when a message is received.
 [03:08:27 PM] <Eric[nK]> However, your text is sent using UTF-8.

 [07:15:43 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but i cant yet control the normal trigger (i havent made it a setting)
 [07:15:58 PM] <JavaBot> ribose made felbot?
 [07:16:03 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> no
 [07:16:07 PM] <JavaBot> o
 [07:16:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> joe made most of it
 [07:16:25 PM] <JavaBot> oic
 [07:16:28 PM] <C.Winchester> Are the SB plugins compatable with felbot?
 [07:16:40 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> no, because felbot is in c#
 [07:16:44 PM] <C.Winchester> Ahh
 [07:17:02 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i have seen where its possible to add a script control of sorts to a program
 [07:17:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> .net program
 [07:17:22 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but its not that easy to implement
 [07:17:38 PM] <C.Winchester> Is it possible to make felbot read vbs? Or is that like Japanese and German?
 [07:17:46 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> it is
 [07:17:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> New on StealthBot Recent:  Auto-Safelist Clan Members
 [07:18:05 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> You add a VBs Class bla bla bla
 [07:18:07 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it is, however with programming and time, you should know anything is possible ;p
 [07:18:18 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [07:18:24 PM] <C.Winchester> Not everything is possible...
 [07:18:24 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Like High Speed Video Porn
 [07:18:39 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> there are...limitations
 [07:18:49 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> But those limits are to seperate things
 [07:18:51 PM] <JavaBot> ...
 [07:18:59 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> (lol)
 [07:19:04 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> however i think the script control (really just something that compiles .net code on the fly and runs it) had a vbs "language" that could be added
 [07:19:12 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Lol
 [07:19:14 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> ^^

 [07:19:44 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I think anything is possible
 [07:19:49 PM] <C.Winchester> Can you make a bot react to voice commands?
 [07:19:53 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> You could...
 [07:19:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ... yes
 [07:20:01 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> That would be a pain in the ass
 [07:20:13 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> find some program that interprets voice commands

 [07:20:31 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and feed the interpreted text to stealthbot's script control
 [07:20:34 PM] <C.Winchester> Can you impliment that software into SB without it becoming a massive file?
 [07:20:39 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [07:20:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> probably not
 [07:20:45 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Unless Stealth does it himself
 [07:20:52 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Then again

 [07:22:55 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Because Joe made it?
 [07:22:58 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ...
 [07:23:00 PM] <C.Winchester> But it doesn't function with SC, so that sort of disables testing for it.
 [07:23:02 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I dunno
