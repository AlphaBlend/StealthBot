 [12:54:09 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> you can do it with code in like 10 lines
 [12:54:16 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Create 2 tables
 [12:54:23 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> 11 lines
 [12:54:26 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> each with at least 10 columns?
 [12:54:32 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> still 11 lines
 [12:54:39 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I don't know how to

 [12:55:05 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I know
 [12:55:07 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> It does not say
 [12:55:09 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create.asp
 [12:55:11 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> how to create tables
 [12:55:16 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> O.o
 [12:55:35 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> CREATE TABLE `noobs` (`name`)
 [12:55:38 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> And you execute that via
 [12:55:40 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> varchar
 [12:55:45 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> Object.Execute
 [12:55:46 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> ..
 [12:55:51 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Well no duh
 [12:55:56 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> What object should I be using
 [12:55:57 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> ADO?
 [12:56:03 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> the only one there is
 [12:56:06 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> ?
 [12:56:11 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Well yes Ado
 [12:56:15 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> But ADO.What
 [12:56:26 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> object.execute "create.."
 [12:56:34 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Connection
 [12:56:38 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its not rocket science
 [12:56:40 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> the onject though
 [12:56:42 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its vbs
 [12:56:49 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> ..
 [12:56:51 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I know
 [12:57:21 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> http://www.w3schools.com/ado/default.asp
 [12:57:23 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Which object!
 [12:57:53 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Just the connection?
 [12:57:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Set snSQL = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
 [12:58:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if you want to make it
 [12:58:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> use
 [12:58:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Set cObj = CreateObject("ADOX.Catalog")
 [12:58:32 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> snSQL.Execute "..."
 [12:58:33 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> So use catalog to create tables and such
 [12:58:36 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> no
 [12:58:42 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> the catalog makes it if it doesnt exist
 [12:58:51 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> FSO can do that?
 [12:58:54 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> no
 [12:58:58 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Hmm
 [12:58:59 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its not a normal file
 [12:59:04 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its an sql datanase
 [12:59:22 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> So how does the catalog create it?
 [12:59:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> http://rafb.net/p/zdYES627.html
 [01:00:16 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> snsql
 [01:00:18 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> is declared before
 [01:00:23 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> as an adodb.connection
 [01:00:25 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Yep
 [01:00:32 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Can I set Catalog = nothing
 [01:00:35 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> afterwards?
 [01:00:36 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> you dont have to
 [01:00:48 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> it clears it if you dont declare it publicly
 [01:00:49 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Will I ever need to use cObj again though
 [01:00:52 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> no
 [01:00:53 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> never
 [01:00:59 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> unless you're making a new db
 [01:01:01 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> ok then I am good
 [01:01:03 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> i just used cobj
 [01:01:05 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> you can use anything
 [01:01:06 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> because I know all the rest
 [01:01:14 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Yes I know connection
 [01:01:26 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I know how variables work )
 [01:01:27 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> if you try to execute something
 [01:01:29 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> using the table
 [01:01:29 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> :) *
 [01:01:31 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> and it doesnt exist
 [01:01:35 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> the sql will error
 [01:01:49 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Is there a table exists?
 [01:01:49 PM] <PhiX> HERO
 [01:01:56 PM] <PhiX> IS YOUR TOPIC RESOLVED?
 [01:02:06 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> The download?
 [01:02:09 PM] <PhiX> ya
 [01:02:09 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Yes
 [01:02:16 PM] <PhiX> BAM
 [01:02:16 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> after the mdb is made
 [01:02:19 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> you can connect to it
 [01:02:22 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> with the other object
 [01:02:25 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> and then make the table
 [01:02:28 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Yep
 [01:02:37 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> But if the table already is made
 [01:02:40 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> will it error?
 [01:02:42 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> yes
 [01:02:45 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> but
 [01:02:46 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> thats why
 [01:02:48 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> you make the table
 [01:02:51 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> ohh

 [05:14:04 PM] <Pyro6> that sucks
 [05:14:40 PM] <xRick_Rollx> yeah
 [05:14:46 PM] <xRick_Rollx> the funny thing is
 [05:15:11 PM] <xRick_Rollx> There was a Supervisor there, but he's trying to put the blame on the driver. and the swamper
 [05:15:57 PM] <xRick_Rollx> The truck had a mud pit on the bed, and was bob-tailing it. And a high voltage powerline (which he had about 3 feet of clearance) Arced a spark, and it grounded somehow

 [05:17:21 PM] <xRick_Rollx> The supervisor should have been up there and put a hotstick on the line

 [05:17:53 PM] <xRick_Rollx> They can afford to fire a Driver who can drive a truck, rather than a Supervisor who was sitting at the bottom of the hill, cleaning his truck.
 [05:19:29 PM] <xRick_Rollx> everybody's trying to point fingers, meanwhile the other drivers are the only ones giving a shit that the driver and swamper survived

 [05:21:35 PM] <Pyro6> ?
 [05:21:40 PM] <Hero.A> Is there a way

 [05:22:05 PM] <Hero.A> ?
 [05:22:07 PM] <VBScript> yes
 [05:22:12 PM] <Hero.A> Ok thanks
 [05:22:18 PM] <VBScript> you dont even need call..
 [05:22:21 PM] <Hero.A> I know
 [05:22:25 PM] <VBScript> call is only if you want to use it like a function
 [05:22:37 PM] <Hero.A> And connection
 [05:22:52 PM] <VBScript> ?
 [05:22:54 PM] <Hero.A> When I do sql = hlSQL.Execute "Select * From Players"
 [05:22:58 PM] <Hero.A> What would be returned?
 [05:23:08 PM] <Hero.A> Or would i want
 [05:23:12 PM] <Hero.A> to use recordset
 [05:23:19 PM] <VBScript> it would error
 [05:23:22 PM] <VBScript> thats a function
 [05:23:27 PM] <Hero.A> In know
 [05:23:29 PM] <Hero.A> I forgot ( )
 [05:23:30 PM] <VBScript> you're calling it like a sub
 [05:23:47 PM] <VBScript> it would return an object
 [05:23:56 PM] <Hero.A> A recordset obj?
 [05:23:59 PM] <VBScript> you have to use Set
 [05:24:09 PM] <VBScript> look at other plugins with sql
 [05:24:13 PM] <Hero.A> Ok then but it would return ADODB.Recordset?
 [05:24:27 PM] <VBScript> i dont know
 [05:24:28 PM] <Hero.A> ill just use
 [05:24:33 PM] <VBScript> i only ever use .getrows
 [05:25:03 PM] <Hero.A> hlRS.Open Select * From Players
 [05:25:12 PM] <Hero.A> And pyro say s` ` are not needed
 [05:25:18 PM] <VBScript> they arent
