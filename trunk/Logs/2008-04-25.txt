 [08:57:39 PM] <vi[r]us> if the government bent the rules for everyone
 [08:57:42 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> because he was in fuckin pain
 [08:57:45 PM] <vi[r]us> stupid people would be outside
 [08:57:49 PM] <vi[r]us> he should have went to his dr
 [08:57:52 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> no instead they dont
 [08:57:53 PM] <vi[r]us> and got a legal note
 [08:57:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> see, you think it's "OK" to do something illegal if he has a good reason?

 [09:03:10 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> it really should be

 [09:03:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> "POTS GUD"
 [09:03:25 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> yes it should be
 [09:03:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> smoking is legal
 [09:03:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> cigarettes
 [09:03:41 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ur point?
 [09:03:56 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> none?
 [09:04:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it wouldnt be if normal people had something to do about it
 [09:04:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but more people smoke than not
 [09:04:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's no reason to ban it; you can sit an argue about its health implications all day, but the federal government should have no right to pass laws against what we can and can not do with our own bodies.
 [09:04:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> so they lose
 [09:04:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you're argument for why pot should be legal is "i like it and it hasnt hurt me yet"
 [09:04:23 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> yes but now a days
 [09:04:27 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> its all about what it dos to others

 [09:04:51 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> uh the smoke that comes off the joint?
 [09:05:02 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> lol
 [09:05:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Business owners should also retain the right to tell people what they can and can not do within their business.
 [09:05:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> smoking sections are stupid

 [09:07:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> "Oh, if we legalize marijuana, people will be smoking in schools, restraunts and having illicit sex in the streets."
 [09:07:42 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> lawl
 [09:07:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Just like, "if we legalize gay marriage, the next thing we'll see is people marrying wild animals and house pets."
 [09:08:09 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah.....................................
 [09:08:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Silly arguments without any valid justification.
 [09:08:19 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> those people will also be able to drive
 [09:08:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> k so, today every gay person in my school took this "vow of silence"
 [09:08:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and do other things
 [09:08:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> they were so pissed
 [09:08:29 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> that require good concentration
 [09:08:46 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#12318](5286) * @Lan plays with his privates. | <Rintaun> ... | <@Lan> I got these new toy soldiers | <@Lan> They are really neat>
 [09:08:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Slipperly slope arguments are without merit; California is one of the few states to allow the usage of medicinal marijuana, and we're also one of the few states to wish to ban smoking in virtually all public venues.
 [09:09:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> medicinal marijuana, good
 [09:09:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> We're trying to pass a law to prevent people from smoking in apartment buildings because of second hand smoke.
 [09:09:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's entirely possible to be both liberal and conservative.
 [09:09:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if it's medical
 [09:09:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> sure?
 [09:09:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but i doubt these teenagers need it
 [09:09:51 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> who said anything
 [09:09:57 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> about teenagers smoking it
 [09:10:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What if the age was set to something like 18 or 21?
 [09:10:14 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> i think
 [09:10:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> for smoking? why
 [09:10:18 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> alcohol
 [09:10:20 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> should be 18
 [09:10:28 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> and marijuana, if ever legal, should be 18
 [09:10:30 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> alchohol, should stay at 21.
 [09:10:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it's illegal at all ages because of the same reason
 [09:10:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Well, your argument is that you don't want teenagers smoking.
 [09:10:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> no
 [09:10:39 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> And marijauna should be 21 as well.
 [09:10:46 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> what is that reason tho
 [09:10:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> my argument is teenagers don't need medical marijuana
 [09:10:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so why do they smoke it
 [09:11:01 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> because, people are more mature.
 [09:11:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> even if the person is 50, and smoke it
 [09:11:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it's still bad
 [09:11:10 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ye well
 [09:11:27 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> its my body
 [09:11:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> age doesn't bring full maturaty.
 [09:11:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> fuck spelling
 [09:11:40 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> i should control
 [09:11:42 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> what goes into my body
 [09:11:44 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> not the government
 [09:11:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> uh
 [09:11:48 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Well, to the government i suppose it does.
 [09:11:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why are you here, Jack?
 [09:11:54 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> as long as i dont kill some1
 [09:11:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you should control what goes in the bodies of people around you too?
 [09:12:06 PM] -- idiat [47ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (59 wins).
 [09:12:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because my mom had unprotected sex eric
 [09:12:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Technically, spending your days on Battle.net has no purpose.
 [09:12:20 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> lol
 [09:12:27 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> it does
 [09:12:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i've learned tons being on battle.net
 [09:12:39 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ive learned
 [09:12:40 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> how to
 [09:12:40 PM] <idiat> that's the spirit
 [09:12:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Some would argue that such long periods of time on the computer is actually a mental disability, requiring therapy.
 [09:12:51 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> well
 [09:12:52 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> there wrong
 [09:12:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but i'm not on my computer 24/7
 [09:12:54 PM] <idiat> i would not argue that
 [09:12:59 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> unless
 [09:13:01 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ur addicted
 [09:13:02 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> !
 [09:13:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If drugs are so worthless and are therefore justifiably illegal, then why not Battle.net?
 [09:13:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Or video games altogether?
 [09:13:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> battle.net doesn't harm other people
 [09:13:18 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> lets
 [09:13:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Or anything that provides us with entertainment?
 [09:13:22 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> WoW does
 [09:13:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it doesn't kill people
 [09:13:24 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> :p
 [09:13:27 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> WoW does!
 [09:13:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Tell that to Andy.

 [09:13:47 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> wait nvm
 [09:13:48 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> WoW does not cause people to die, it's the retarded people who can't seperate the life from game
 [09:13:49 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> is good
 [09:13:51 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> for the soul
 [09:13:51 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> !
 [09:13:52 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ^^
 [09:13:58 PM] <idiat> battle.net isn't saleable
 [09:14:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> WHATS LIFE
 [09:14:06 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ???
 [09:14:10 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is life
 [09:14:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> I THINK I HAVE 1 IN MY STASH

 [09:14:19 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> wiki life
 [09:14:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> wiki life
 [09:14:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Life is a condition that distinguishes organisms from non-living objects, i.e.
 [09:14:20 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> as long
 [09:14:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Life is a condition that distinguishes organisms from non-living objects, i.e.
 [09:14:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, and marijuana doesn't cause people to die -- it's just the "retarded" people who can't separate a leisure activity from every day enjoyment.
 [09:14:30 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> ye but some may argue
 [09:14:31 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> that
 [09:14:36 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> u cant control urself
 [09:14:39 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> THE IDIOTS
 [09:14:40 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Eric[nK], not everyone wants smoke in their body
 [09:14:45 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> I CANT CONTROL MY URGES
 [09:14:51 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> TO HAVE SEX
 [09:14:52 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> AND YET U STILL GETIT
 [09:14:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> video games don't cause OTHER people to do anything they dont want to do
 [09:15:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, I'm not going to continue this argument because it diverges into the "drugs are bad and therefore we should ban them" argument that I've already argued against many times.
 [09:15:12 PM] <SmOkEdAcAlIdOjA@Azeroth> UVE BEEN

 [09:19:51 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's why i said _basically_
 [09:19:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> cops can just go to your door and ask to search for no reason, no lead or no info whatsoever
