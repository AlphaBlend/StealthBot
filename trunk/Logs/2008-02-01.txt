 [02:50:50 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [02:50:51 PM] <Alendar> Would I need ; after this $title = $pagetitle; ?
 [02:51:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes.
 [02:51:05 PM] <Alendar> OK, thank you.
 [02:51:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> PHP has line terminators.  You need them after every executable statement.
 [02:51:36 PM] <Alendar> Ah.
 [02:52:44 PM] <Alendar> Is there a way to call a variable before it's declared?
 [02:52:46 PM] <Alendar> Like this:
 [02:52:55 PM] <Alendar> Echo $title;
 [02:53:04 PM] <Alendar> $title = "Blah";
 [02:54:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> In PHP, yes, but it won't contain the string "Blah" until after that statement has executed.
 [02:54:45 PM] <Alendar> Hmm, because I want the title of pages to be differnt and I am using three different php documents.
 [02:55:04 PM] <Alendar> header.php, contents.php, and footer.php
 [02:55:16 PM] <Alendar> I want the $title to go into the contents.
 [02:55:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why in the world did you set up your php page like it were an html page?
 [02:56:09 PM] <Alendar> Uhhh...
 [02:56:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm
 [02:56:16 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ;o
 [02:56:19 PM] <Alendar> Sorry, that didn't make sense to me.
 [02:56:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> index.php should be used for all three of those pages.
 [02:56:52 PM] <Alendar> Yes, I know but I call header and footer in other .php pages.
 [02:57:03 PM] <Alendar> http://alendar.no-ip.org/pdb/index.php
 [02:57:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, you can create an html page for each, the header and footer and then include them in your php pages.
 [02:58:15 PM] <Alendar> Ah.
 [02:58:18 PM] <Alendar> I get it.
 [02:58:29 PM] <Alendar> Yet, how would I set the title?
 [02:58:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Through the php page or through the header html page.
 [02:59:23 PM] <Alendar> The PHP page.
 [02:59:30 PM] <Alendar> I think.
