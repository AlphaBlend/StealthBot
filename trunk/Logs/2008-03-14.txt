 [05:23:11 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> not sure
 [05:23:48 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> you can try say 20..
 [05:24:00 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> ??

 [05:25:08 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> well you can try the  stream.read method o.o
 [05:25:23 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> hrm
 [05:25:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> dont use a stream
 [05:25:25 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> use
 [05:25:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> an array
 [05:25:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> of bytes...
 [05:25:33 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> exactly.
 [05:25:41 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Can i use your packetbuffer?

 [05:29:51 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> GET YOUR OWN CODE !!!!!!!!!
 [05:29:56 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> lmfao
 [05:30:03 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> omg funnel.

 [05:30:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> etc
 [05:30:14 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> look it up on GOOGLE
 [05:30:15 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> b(0) = bla
 [05:30:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> in this case
 [05:30:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you want to put it after byte
 [05:30:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> since its an array of bytes
 [05:30:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> not a byte array
 [05:30:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> >.>
 [05:30:45 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> aww
 [05:30:47 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> CONFUSION
 [05:30:48 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> gg?
 [05:30:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [05:30:49 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lmao
 [05:30:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Dim b() as Byte = array of bytes
 [05:31:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Dim b as Byte() = byte array
 [05:31:09 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> OHOH
 [05:31:16 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Dim b(1024) as Byte = array of bytes with definition
 [05:31:19 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> That makes sense
 [05:31:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you're gonna use redim a lot
 [05:31:36 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> byte array = it's gay = that just fucking ryhmed wooot!!
 [05:31:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ReDim Preserve
 [05:31:53 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> ok
 [05:32:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Dim b as Byte() = {&HFF}
 [05:32:02 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> So it would be redim preserve arr
 [05:32:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> redim it + 1
 [05:32:06 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> add the id
 [05:32:09 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> oh oh
 [05:32:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> redim +2
 [05:32:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> insert the length
 [05:32:14 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> redim +4
 [05:32:16 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> insert a dword
 [05:32:17 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> etc
 [05:32:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats what the buffer does for you
 [05:32:32 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I never figured out what Redim PRESERVE does
 [05:32:40 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if you dont have preserve
 [05:32:42 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it clears the array
 [05:32:45 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I know what Redim is...just not preserve
 [05:32:47 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> oh
 [05:33:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> preserve = preserve items?
 [05:33:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i guess
 [05:33:08 PM] No such user(s) found.
 [05:33:13 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [05:33:15 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> you'd think
 [05:33:17 PM] User(s) found: New_Group_#2 (group), 
 [05:33:18 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> But its microsoft
 [05:33:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if you throw an exception
 [05:33:21 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> they fuck everything up
 [05:33:22 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> preserve arrays o.o
 [05:33:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you can see the contents
 [05:33:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> of your array
 [05:33:34 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> :O
 [05:33:37 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> cool
 [05:33:47 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you may also want to write a buffer for receiving
 [05:33:51 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah
 [05:33:54 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> That was my idea **
 [05:33:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> that includes the gay algorithm that combines packets

 [05:34:14 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Im going to use MBNCSutil
 [05:34:18 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> And get a general idea form that

 [05:34:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its closed source
 [05:34:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> isnt it?
 [05:34:26 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> uh
 [05:34:27 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> no its not
 [05:34:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> then doit.
 [05:34:32 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> you go to the site
 [05:34:35 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Its right on there
 [05:34:37 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [05:34:44 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> But it uses a stream
 [05:34:49 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> i think it does anyways
 [05:34:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> eww
 [05:34:55 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth>         private MemoryStream m_ms;
 [05:34:55 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth>         private int m_len = 0;
 [05:34:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> NEVER USE TEXT FOR BINARY CHATZ
 [05:34:57 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> yup
 [05:35:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its a memory stream
 [05:35:05 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> never use Streams?
 [05:35:06 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats ok
 [05:35:08 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> oh
 [05:35:08 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK]
 [05:35:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no

 [05:35:42 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and we didnt agree
 [05:35:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but he was right..
 [05:35:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> SO TAKE MY ADVICE
 [05:35:50 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> memorystream is the same is System.IO.Stream
 [05:35:52 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> ?
 [05:36:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i dont think so
 [05:36:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#65174] <an_ass733> How do you tell if your roommate is gay?  When his dick tastes like shit.>
 [05:36:09 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> hmm
 [05:36:17 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Thats the only stream i can find
 [05:36:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> unless mbncs util uses .net
 [05:36:26 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> What's so hard about you just using a Stream?
 [05:36:31 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> joe, maybe because your a sr.member?
 [05:36:35 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> It does

 [05:36:45 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> text for bnet bots is bad
 [05:36:49 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Theres differenc streams
