 [05:33:47 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but
 [05:33:50 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> then one day you're reading over wx demos and you find out all sorts of stuff
 [05:33:53 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i dont like the individual whisper windows
 [05:33:55 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> idiatic, does JavaBot support multiple profiles?

 [05:34:08 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Alendar: Maybe?
 [05:34:15 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Pyro6: It's a plugin. You can disable it.
 [05:34:24 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Like MirageBot.
 [05:34:29 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Tabbed bots.
 [05:34:49 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> That's possible but not implemented.
 [05:35:11 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Currently it will load any config file/folder you specify in command used to run it or in loadlist.txt
 [05:35:29 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> But there is no manager to put the bots together.
 [05:36:31 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Also are you going to add BotNet or IRC?
 [05:36:51 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Probably. IRC more likely than BotNet, since I might actually use IRC.
 [05:37:26 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> I like this bot.

 [07:34:26 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
 [07:34:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> haha
 [07:34:29 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Aperture Science

 [07:34:39 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> but there's no sense crying over every mistake
 [07:34:43 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> you just keep on trying until you run out of cake
 [07:34:45 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> hmm
 [07:34:47 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> and the science gets done and you make a neat gun

 [07:34:56 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> I'm being so sincere right now
 [07:35:00 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> even though you broke my heart and killed me
 [07:35:03 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> and torn into pieces
 [07:35:05 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> and threw every piece into a fire
 [07:35:09 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
 [07:35:13 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Now these points of data make a wonderful line
 [07:35:16 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
 [07:35:19 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> so I'm glad I got burned
 [07:35:24 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Think of all the things we learned for the people that are still alive
 [07:35:27 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> go ahead and leave me
 [07:35:29 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> I think I prefer to stay inside
 [07:35:33 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> maybe you'll find someone else to help you
 [07:35:36 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> maybe black mesa
 [07:35:39 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> that was a joke, haha, fat chance
 [07:35:42 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist
 [07:35:46 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> look at me still talking, when there's science to do
 [07:35:50 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you

 [07:38:56 PM] <DeAtHZeRg@Azeroth> afk
 [07:39:23 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> The real problem was that I allowed blank chat messages to be sent. I'm pretty sure I catch that somewhere else but it broke the command processor so it's best to catch it right off I always say.
 [07:42:29 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Okay that no longer breaks the command processor.
 [07:44:19 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> wtf?
 [07:44:21 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Lol
 [07:44:26 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> my command processor is simple

 [07:45:41 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [07:45:52 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> all it does is read from an XML file for command info, tests against multiple triggers and a few regular expressions, then uses an events system to call the actual command subrouters
 [07:45:58 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [07:46:03 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> What I did
 [07:46:06 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I was a little pissed off
 [07:46:15 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> But its the only way i could figure out how to do custom commands
 [07:46:24 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> Because c# doesn't allow unconstant cases

 [07:46:37 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I always had to use a constant case like case "cmd1":
 [07:46:53 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> So what I did
 [07:46:55 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Python doesn't use switch statements at all
 [07:46:58 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> oh?
 [07:47:17 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> Generally people recommend using dictionaries when you would normally use a switch statement, from what I've read.
 [07:47:24 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> ah
 [07:47:28 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> I don't
 [07:47:42 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> well it's REQUIRED in Python
 [07:47:59 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> unless you want to make 10000000000 if/then statements FUCK
