	' CD-Key Decoding
	
	' Call kd_init() first to set up the decoding system, unless you are only using kd_quick().
	' Then call kd_create() to create a key decoder "handle" each time you want to
	' decode a CD-key.  It will return the handle or -1 on failure.  The handle
	' should then be passed as the "decoder" argument to all the other kd_ functions.
	' Call kd_free() on the handle when finished with the decoder to free the
	' memory it is using.
	
	' Key decoding declarations and logic moved to clsKeyDecoder. (2016-3-26, -Pyro)
	
	
	'New Logon System
	
	' Call nls_init() to get a "handle" to an NLS object (nls_init will return 0
	' if it encounters an error).  This "handle" should be passed as the "NLS"
	' argument to all the other nls_* functions.  You do not need to change the
	' username and password to upper-case as nls_init() will do this for you.
	' Call nls_free() on the handle to free the memory it's using.
	' nls_account_create() and nls_account_logon() generate the bodies of
	' SID_AUTH_ACCOUNTCREATE and SID_AUTH_ACCOUNTLOGIN packets, respectively.
	
	' Logon system declarations and logic moved to clsNLS.
