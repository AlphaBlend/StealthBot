  <h2>Getting Started with StealthBot</h2>

  <p>
    I've broken this page down into two sections: initial setup in 
    <strong>Setting Up Us the Bot</strong> and getting your bot to listen to you in 
    <strong>Adding Yourself to the Bot</strong>. Enjoy!
  </p>

  <h2>Setting Up Us the Bot</h2>

  <p>
    When you fire up your bot, you'll see a series of menus at the top. Click  on
    the Settings menu and select Bot Settings. The settings screen will 
    appear. Click the button labeled <strong>Step-by-Step Configuration</strong> and 
    follow the prompts to fill out the connection portion of setup.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you'd like, browse through some of the other settings panels on the 
    left and see if any other options need changing. Otherwise, your bot is 
    ready to go; click <strong>Apply and Close</strong>, then click the <strong>Connect</strong> 
    menu, and you're ready to go!
  </p>

  <h2>Adding Yourself to the Bot</h2>

  <p>
    Here's the deal: The bot can't read your mind. It just compares letters and numbers and decides
    whether or not you are who you say you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, how do you get it to recognize your in-game account so that it listens to what you tell it to do?
  </p>

  <p>
    The easiest way to go about this is to do the following:

    <ol>
      <li>Click in the text box where you would type to talk to people on Battle.net.</li>
      <li>Type (without quotes): "/add"</li>
      <li>Hit the spacebar</li>
      <li>Double-click on your name in the channel list on the right side of the bot</li>
      <li>Hit the spacebar again, then type (without quotes): "999"</li>
      <li>Press ENTER.</li>
    </ol>

    After following those steps, you should be able to use any commands listed in the other section of this readme.
